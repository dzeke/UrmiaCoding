The temporal variations of supplied water to different demands are assessed as provisioning hydrological ecosystem services. Then, three agricultural drought management policies have been defined for each water supply-demand alternative to reduce the irrigation water and cultivated area of the agricultural demand nodes during droughts. In addition to the net primary productivity criterion (NPP) and economic profit, the ecological condition of the system has been evaluated as an ecosystem services-based criterion. To prioritize and select the best water resources management (WRM) scenario(s), a game theory-based hierarchical evidential reasoning (ER) technique with multiple decision-makers has been used. The proposed methodology has been applied to the Urmia Lake basin, which is the largest saline lake in the Middle East. The grade-based values of the criteria have been used to compare the WRM scenarios. The results show that a scenario that includes supplying 100% of the lake's water demand has the highest priority. This scenario also suggests reducing the cultivated area of dominant crops and using deficit irrigation practices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schulz, S</author><author>Darehshouri, S</author><author>Hassanzadeh, E</author><author>Tajrishy, M</author><author>Schüth, C</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change or irrigated agriculture – what drives the water level decline of Lake Urmia</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-019-57150-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 5</notes><research-notes>cited By 5</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077911995&amp;doi=10.1038%2Fs41598-019-57150-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4cc06bca8b72f6e03a3e2bfdc6a77347</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lake Urmia is one of the largest hypersaline lakes on earth with a unique biodiversity. Over the past two decades the lake water level declined dramatically, threatening the functionality of the lake’s ecosystems. There is a controversial debate about the reasons for this decline, with either mismanagement of the water resources, or climatic changes assumed to be the main cause. In this study we quantified the water budget components of Lake Urmia and analyzed their temporal evolution and interplay over the last five decades. With this we can show that variations of Lake Urmia’s water level during the analyzed period were mainly triggered by climatic changes. However, under the current climatic conditions agricultural water extraction volumes are significant compared to the remaining surface water inflow volumes. Changes in agricultural water withdrawal would have a significant impact on the lake volume and could either stabilize the lake, or lead to its complete collapse. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Motlaghzadeh, K</author><author>Kerachian, R</author><author>Tavvafi, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An evidential reasoning-based leader-follower game for hierarchical multi-agent decision making under uncertainty</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><volume>591</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125294</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088663199&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhydrol.2020.125294&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ee6925e8ee292a5687ebc8685b8ef66c</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In multi-agent decision making, agents’ decisions are coherently interdependent, and the objectives of agents are possibly inconsistent. In this type of decision-making, agents need to reason and act strategically. Therefore, game theory can be used to study the strategic interactions among decision-makers. This paper presents a new hierarchical decision-making methodology, which uses the advantages of both game theory (i.e. Stackelberg leadership model) and Evidential Reasoning (ER). ER, as a multi-attribute decision-making method, considers both qualitative and quantitative attributes, and incorporates existing uncertainties in evaluating alternatives. The backward induction method and Monte-Carlo theory are used to solve the deterministic and stochastic forms of the proposed leader–follower game. The methodology is applied to choose the best restoration scenario for Urmia Lake, which is the biggest saltwater lake in the Middle East. In the past decade, the lake's surface area has dramatically decreased due to climate change and an anthropogenic drought. In this paper, 19 lake restoration scenarios have been evaluated, and a scenario, which is corresponding to a 40% reduction in agricultural water consumption and water release from Nezam Abad dam, is found to be the equilibrium solution for both types of the game. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dehghanipour, A H</author><author>Schoups, G</author><author>Zahabiyoun, B</author><author>Babazadeh, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Meeting agricultural and environmental water demand in endorheic irrigated river basins: A simulation-optimization approach applied to the Urmia Lake basin in Iran</title><secondary-title>Agricultural Water Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Agricultural Water Management</full-title></periodical><volume>241</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106353</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087280442&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.agwat.2020.106353&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=959f402d1bd3e6ea5c8f4244f46871a1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Competition for water between agriculture and the environment is a growing problem in irrigated regions across the globe, especially in endorheic basins with downstream freshwater lakes impacted by upstream irrigation withdrawals. This study presents and applies a novel simulation-optimization (SO) approach for identifying water management strategies in such settings. Our approach combines three key features for increased exploration of strategies. First, minimum environmental flow requirements are treated as a decision variable in the optimization model, yielding more flexibility than existing approaches that either treat it as a precomputed constraint or as an objective to be maximized. Second, conjunctive use is included as a management option by using dynamically coupled surface water (WEAP) and groundwater (MODFLOW) simulation models. Third, multi-objective optimization is used to yield entire Pareto sets of water management strategies that trade off between meeting environmental and agricultural water demand. The methodology is applied to the irrigated Miyandoab Plain, located upstream of endorheic Lake Urmia in Northwestern Iran. Results identify multiple strategies, i.e., combinations of minimum environmental flow requirements, deficit irrigation, and crop selection, that simultaneously increase environmental flow (up to 16 %) and agricultural profit (up to 24 %) compared to historical conditions. Results further show that significant temporary drops in agricultural profit occur during droughts when long-term profit is maximized, but that this can be avoided by increasing groundwater pumping capacity and temporarily reducing the lake's minimum environmental flow requirements. Such a strategy is feasible during moderate droughts when resulting declines in groundwater and lake water levels fully recover after each drought. Overall, these results demonstrate the usefulness and flexibility of the methodology in identifying a range of potential water management strategies in complex irrigated endorheic basins like the Lake Urmia basin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alizadeh Motaghi, F</author><author>Hamzehpour, N</author><author>Mola Ali Abasiyan, S</author><author>Rahmati, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The wind erodibility in the newly emerged surfaces of Urmia Playa Lake and adjacent agricultural lands and its determining factors</title><secondary-title>Catena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Catena</full-title></periodical><volume>194</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.catena.2020.104675</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085216139&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.catena.2020.104675&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3cf259a402e5526d1584c40b1662dfec</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Despite the great extent of Urmia Playa Lake (UPL), researchers have rarely ever studied the development of playa surfaces and their vulnerability to dust emission. Therefore, we aimed the current research to study the formation of UPL surfaces and how their physicochemical, mineralogical and geomorphological characteristics affect their susceptibility to wind erosion. An area of 41 km2 was chosen including lands from UPL and adjacent Agricultural Lands (AL). Different playa surfaces were identified on different geomorphic surfaces and mapped using Landsat images. Later, 75 soil samples from depth of 0–5 cm of different map units were collected and subjected to physicochemical analysis. Soil Erodible Fraction (EF) was also measured as an index for the wind erodibility of the examined soil surfaces. X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) analysis of soil samples from three playa surfaces with significantly different EF values were also conducted. Major reasons for the development of different playa surfaces were found to be basically related to geomorphic surfaces on which they have developed, size and mineralogical composition of the sediments as well as the landscape position and depth to the groundwater. Statistical analysis of EF of different playa surfaces and AL showed that Salt Crusts (SC) had the lowest mean EF value due to the formation of a thin layer of salt on its surface as it has developed on low stand geomorphic surface being fine-textured by nature and rich in Na, Mg and Cl ions. Abandoned Agricultural lands (AA) and AL had the highest mean EF values. High sand content of soils with anthropogenic origin along with conventional tillage practices resulting in soil organic matter loss and over grazing were the major reasons of their high EF. Therefore, these surfaces need to be monitored carefully and to be of high priority of conservation and dust control programs in the region. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saemian, P</author><author>Elmi, O</author><author>Vishwakarma, B D</author><author>Tourian, M J</author><author>Sneeuw, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyzing the Lake Urmia restoration progress using ground-based and spaceborne observations</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>739</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139857</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086594956&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2020.139857&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f5b56c6d80b69632f21390755e0137df</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lake Urmia, located in the North West of Iran, was once the most extensive permanent hypersaline lake in the world. Unsustainable water management in response to increasing demand together with climatic extremes have given rise to the lake's depletion during the last two decades. The Urmia Lake Restoration Program (ULRP) was established in 2013 and aims to restore the lake within a 10-year program. This study aims to monitor these restoration endeavours using spaceborne and ground-based observations. We analyzed the in-situ water level, the surface water extent, and the water volume of the lake. The water storage change of the Urmia Lake catchment is quantified using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On satellite observations, which gives us a holistic view of hydrological components. Our analysis shows a positive trend of 14.5 cm/yr, 204 km2/yr, and 0.42 km3/yr in the time series of lake water level, lake water area, and water volume from 2015 to 2019 which indicates a short-lived stabilization of Lake Urmia. This has been achieved mainly due to an increase of 0.35 km3/yr in inflow from rivers to the lake, predominantly driven by anomalous precipitation events in 2016 and early 2019. However, the long-term trend from 2003 to 2019 still shows negative values of −22 cm/yr, −200 km2/yr, and −0.72 km3/yr for the water level, the surface area, and the water volume of the lake, respectively. The stabilization seems to be fragile however, since most of the increase in the water volume of the lake has spread over the large shallow southern region with high evaporation potential during hot seasons. Furthermore, due to the high correlation between the lake water level and precipitation, the recovery observed in 2016 and the first half of 2019 might not continue in case of a long drought period. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Valizadeh, N</author><author>Bijani, M</author><author>Karimi, H</author><author>Naeimi, A</author><author>Hayati, D</author><author>Azadi, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effects of farmers’ place attachment and identity on water conservation moral norms and intention</title><secondary-title>Water Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Research</full-title></periodical><volume>185</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.watres.2020.116131</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089494867&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.watres.2020.116131&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=77ea82d1576f6723562e9530d96acbe4</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Investment in the behavioral change projects would not be possible without knowing their prerequisites and determinants including intention, moral norms, identity, and place attachment. Therefore, this study aimed at the determination of the effects of place attachment (PAT) (place dependence (PDE), place identity (PID), and place affect (PAF)) and farmers’ identity (conservationist identity (CONID) and productivist identity (PROID)) on the moral norms of water conservation (MNWC) as well as the intention of water conservation (IWC) of the Iranian farmers. This was a descriptive-correlational and causal-relational study. The instrument of the study was a questionnaire completed using a cross-sectional survey and face-to-face interviews. Hence, a stratified random sampling method along with a proportionate allocation was used to select 380 farmers. The research findings indicated that the PAT (PDE, PID, and PAF) and CONID had significant positive effects on the MNWC. In addition, MNWC and CONID had significant positive effects on the IWC. However, PROID had a significant negative effect on the MNWC and IWC. In general, it was found that independent variables (PDE, PID, PAF, PROID, and CONID) could predict 39% and 53% of the variance of the MNWC and IWC variables, respectively. Moreover, the social-psychological framework of the study provides practitioners, decision-makers, policymakers, researchers, and other stakeholders of the agricultural water management with useful practical and theoretical insights about the practices of behavior changes and social interventions. Finally, it is recommended that government decision-makers should further focus on the increased attractiveness of the rural and agricultural areas to increase PAT, MNWC, and IWC. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sattari, M T</author><author>Mirabbasi, R</author><author>Jarhan, S</author><author>Shaker Sureh, F</author><author>Ahmad, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trend and abrupt change analysis in water quality of Urmia Lake in comparison with changes in lake water level</title><secondary-title>Environmental Monitoring and Assessment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Monitoring and Assessment</full-title></periodical><volume>192</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10661-020-08577-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090356547&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs10661-020-08577-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=5884051b4b6606bd78c7419d647d282c</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Urmia Lake, as the largest lake in Iran borders, has a special role in the ecosystem of the region. The water level in this lake declines in recent year remarkably, so monitoring the lake water quality is important from an environmental view. In this research, the changes in the qualitative variables of the lake water (including electrical conductivity (EC), pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR)) are compared with the changes in the lake’s water level based on the Mann-Kendall nonparametric test. Further, abrupt change points in the time series of quality variables were detected by the Pettitt test. Studies were carried out on samples collected from five different stations during 2005–2015. The results showed that the water level of Urmia Lake had a significant decreasing trend and also, except for TDS, the other investigated quality variables had negative trends during the studied period. It was observed that in general, the values of the Z statistic in the stations located in the eastern part of the lake were more than the stations located in the western part, and also the stations located in the northern parts had a higher trend than those in the south of the bridge. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sheibani, S</author><author>Ataie-Ashtiani, B</author><author>Safaie, A</author><author>Simmons, C T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of lakebed sediment deposit on the interaction of hypersaline lake and groundwater: A simplified case of lake Urmia, Iran</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><volume>588</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.125110</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085738266&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhydrol.2020.125110&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=07a850e1cee02dad78f9eca25521136c</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lake Urmia, which was once the second-largest saline lake in the world, has been shrinking dramatically. Moreover, Lake Urmia has become supersaturated with total salinity averaging more than 350 g/l. Salt precipitation and dissolved materials brought by inflowing rivers have formed a layer of sediment with low hydraulic conductivity on the lakebed. Considering the flat bathymetry of Lake Urmia, we conducted a series of numerical simulation scenarios to study the groundwater flow pattern in the vicinity of the hypersaline Lake Urmia using COMSOL Multiphysics®. In the first step, we performed the simulations in steady-state conditions. Secondly, we simulated the lake level fall in 10 years at a rate of −35 cm/year followed by a lake level rise at a rate of 35 cm/year for another 10 years. The steady-state results demonstrate that decreasing sediment hydraulic conductivity layer and increasing its thickness lead to a less intense saltwater intrusion, with lower saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer. As the lake level begins to fall, in cases with high sediment hydraulic conductivity, incoming saltwater from the lake decreases and reaches nearly zero values through the time; instead, the lake begins to get recharged. On the other hand, as the lake level begins to rise after the falling period, the saltwater flux from the lake to the aquifer increases and finally reaches a value of nearly two times greater than steady-state results. In low sediment hydraulic conductivity cases, incoming saltwater from the lake to the aquifer remains negligible through both rising and falling scenarios. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amiri, V</author><author>Berndtsson, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fluoride occurrence and human health risk from groundwater use at the west coast of Urmia Lake, Iran</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-05905-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090337791&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-05905-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=76f81ce690b961853864fe79b09ae037</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We investigated fluoride (F−) concentration and physicochemical features of groundwater in the Urmia coastal aquifer (northwest, Iran). Groundwater samples were collected during both dry (58 wells) and wet seasons (84 wells). Approximately 15 and 23% of the groundwater samples in the dry and wet seasons, respectively, exceeded the recommended F− value by WHO for drinking water (1.5 mg/L). High F− concentration in groundwater is mainly found in shallow wells. The cause of high F− concentration appears to be mainly caused by human activities. Agricultural fertilizers and industrial waste can result in rapid release of F− into the groundwater. Release of F− into the groundwater can, however, also be triggered by the interaction between rock and water. In the experimental area, high F− concentrations were found close to volcanic rocks. Health risks from exposure to F− in groundwater were analyzed for adults and children. Utilizing sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo simulation, the uncertainties in the risk estimates were calculated. Sensitivity analyses showed that the most pertinent variables are F− concentration in drinking water, averaging time, exposure time, and ingestion rate of water. Children are more susceptible to the noncarcinogenic risk of F− in groundwater. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Delavar, M A</author><author>Naderi, A</author><author>Ghorbani, Y</author><author>Mehrpouyan, A</author><author>Bakhshi, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Soil salinity mapping by remote sensing south of Urmia Lake, Iran</title><secondary-title>Geoderma Regional</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geoderma Regional</full-title></periodical><volume>22</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.geodrs.2020.e00317</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088238689&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.geodrs.2020.e00317&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4e021ca6742e6657cc60dfd3ade25f95</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Urmia Lake is a shallow terminal Lake located in northwest Iran and it is one of the largest permanent Lakes in the Middle East. In this study, the changes in soil salinity at Urmia Lake were investigated using satellite images and the oldest salinity map of the area over a period of 45 years from 1973 to 2018. The distribution of salinity in 2018 was estimated using the supervised classification by the nonlinear hybrid model of artificial multi-layered neural network-genetic algorithm model (ANN-GA) while the salinity map for the years of 1985, 1995, 2005 and 2015 was estimated by the unsupervised method. Further, the salinity data of surface soil in the region for the year 1973 was also digitized and utilized. For this purpose, 291 surface samples (258 samples for modeling and 33 samples for the re-evaluation of the model) of the studied region were collected and analyzed in 2018. The input neurons were selected by analyzing the satellite imagery bands, salinity indices, salinity ratio index and normalized difference vegetation index. The correlation coefficient and root-mean-square error of the training network model were equal to 0.94 and 0.04, respectively. The salinity map of the studied region was estimated using this model and classified into six classes (S0 to S5). The produced map of 2018 was used to re-evaluate the results. It showed that lower estimation accuracy was in classes S1 and S2. The obtained results in this study indicated that roughness, moisture, the density of halophyte plants and sodium slickspot were some of the sources for estimation of errors in lower salinity classes. The time-series changes in the salinity class of estimated maps showed that S3, S4 and S5 classes have expanded between 1973 and 2018. These are in agreement with the field observation and with the other scientific reports about the studied area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Han, Q</author><author>Niu, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Construction of the long-term global surface water extent dataset based on water-NDVI spatio-temporal parameter set</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/RS12172675</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090333261&amp;doi=10.3390%2FRS12172675&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2e3657b0a0464293e2e7d9e1643059cf</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Inland surface water is highly dynamic, seasonally and inter-annually, limiting the representativity of the water coverage information that is usually obtained at any single date. The long-term dynamic water extent products with high spatial and temporal resolution are particularly important to analyze the surface water change but unavailable up to now. In this paper, we construct a global water Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) spatio-temporal parameter set based on the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) NDVI. Employing the Google Earth Engine, we construct a new Global Surface Water Extent Dataset (GSWED) with coverage from 2000 to 2018, having an eight-day temporal resolution and a spatial resolution of 250 m. The results show that: (1) the MODIS NDVI-based surface water mapping has better performance compared to other water extraction methods, such as the normalized difference water index, the modified normalized difference water index, and the OTSU (maximal between-cluster variance method). In addition, the water-NDVI spatio-temporal parameter set can be used to update surface water extent datasets after 2018 as soon as the MODIS data are updated. (2) We validated the GSWED using random water samples from the Global Surface Water (GSW) dataset and achieved an overall accuracy of 96% with a kappa coefficient of 0.9. The producer's accuracy and user's accuracy were 97% and 90%, respectively. The validated comparisons in four regions (Qinghai Lake, Selin Co Lake, Utah Lake, and Dead Sea) show a good consistency with a correlation value of above 0.9. (3) The maximum global water area reached 2.41 million km2 between 2000 and 2018, and the global water showed a decreasing trend with a significance of P = 0.0898. (4) Analysis of different types of water area change regions (Selin Co Lake, Urmia Lake, Aral Sea, Chiquita Lake, and Dongting Lake) showed that the GSWED can not only identify the seasonal changes of the surface water area and abrupt changes of hydrological events but also reflect the long-term trend of the water changes. In addition, GSWED has better performance in wetland areas and shallow areas. The GSWED can be used for regional studies and global studies of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and climate models. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Toufigh, V</author><author>Ghassemi, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Control and Stabilization of Fugitive Dust: Using Eco-Friendly and Sustainable Materials</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Geomechanics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Geomechanics</full-title></periodical><volume>20</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1061/(ASCE)GM.1943-5622.0001762</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090463910&amp;doi=10.1061%2F%28ASCE%29GM.1943-5622.0001762&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=74bafe3c89cabe868e84dc921d6f880f</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Untreated soil is prone to erosion and dust generation that result in various environmental and health hazards. The addition of additives has been used as a soil treatment method to tackle this problem. Conventional techniques such as chemical additives impose negative ecological impacts and significant implementation and maintenance costs. This paper evaluates the efficiency of three eco-friendly biopolymers, xanthan gum, guar gum, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) with 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5% concentrations for soil treatment against dust generation. This study also investigates the long-term performance and durability of biopolymers. Three types of samples (dust particles) were collected from different locations that generate the most dust in Iran: Hooralazim lagoon as a source of soil, Urmia lake bed as a source of saline sand, and Sungun copper mine as a source of mine tailing. Approximately 500 samples prepared and treated with different biopolymer concentrations were evaluated by the wind tunnel, moisture retention, surface strength, and uniaxial compression tests to identify the most effective biopolymer. The addition of biopolymers improved moisture retention, surface strength, compressive strength, and mitigation of dust generation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging was also used to study the microstructures of the specimens after treatment. A strong correlation was found between the weight loss after the wind tunnel test versus the maximum penetration force and the uniaxial compressive strength. In terms of dust generation preventive treatment, CMC was more effective than xanthan gum and guar gum. Hence, CMC was introduced as an alternative material for dust control due to its promising potentials. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Javadzadeh, H</author><author>Ataie-Ashtiani, B</author><author>Hosseini, S M</author><author>Simmons, C T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interaction of lake-groundwater levels using cross-correlation analysis: A case study of Lake Urmia Basin, Iran</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>729</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138822</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084393528&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2020.138822&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=93dc5978c590b45b43cad9135e36b00a</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lake Urmia (LU) is the second largest hypersaline lake in the world. Lake Urmia's water level has dropped drastically from 1277.85 m to 1270.08 m a.s.l (equal to 7.77 m) during the last 20 years, equivalent to a loss of 70% of the lake area. The likelihood of lake-groundwater connection on the basin-scale is uncertain and understudied because of lack of basic data and precise information required for physically-based modeling. In this study, cross-correlation analysis is applied on a various time-frames of water level of the lake and groundwater levels (2001–2018) recorded in 797 observation wells across 17 adjacent aquifers. This provides insightful information on the lake-groundwater interaction. The cross-correlation coefficient between the monthly water level of lake and observations wells (rGW−L) and the difference of these two variables (Hf) was calculated for different time-frames. The values of rGW−L (ranged −0.69 to 0.97) and Hf (ranged −53 m to 293 m) indicated the significant role of time-frames of observed dataset on dynamic behavior of lake-groundwater interaction, and exchange fluxes in the study setting. Results suggested two opposing behaviors in lake-groundwater interaction of the study system mainly arise from anthropogenic activity (overexploitation of groundwater for irrigation) and aquifer type (unconfined/pressurized): three out of 17 adjacent aquifers are feeding by the LU and act as “gaining aquifers” (located in northern half of LU) and others discharging into the LU and act as “losing aquifers”. This study aimed to provide easy-to-obtain insights into LGWI in the complex setting of LU Basin. It can be considered a preliminary step towards a deeper understanding of the interaction through physically-based analysis and modeling. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dehghanipour, A H</author><author>Panahi, D M</author><author>Mousavi, H</author><author>Kalantari, Z</author><author>Tajrishy, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of water level decline in Lake Urmia, Iran, on local climate conditions</title><secondary-title>Water (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/W12082153</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089876641&amp;doi=10.3390%2FW12082153&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7c1780295960d12c579a0b147c9ca357</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lake Urmia in northwestern Iran is the largest lake in Iran and the second largest saltwater lake in the world. The water level in Lake Urmia has decreased dramatically in recent years, due to drought, climate change, and the overuse of water resources for irrigation. This shrinking of the lake may affect local climate conditions, assuming that the lake itself affects the local climate. In this study, we quantified the lake's impact on the local climate by analyzing hourly time series of data on climate variables (temperature, vapor pressure, relative humidity, evaporation, and dewpoint temperature for all seasons, and local lake/land breezes in summer) for the period 1961-2016. For this, we compared high quality, long-term climate data obtained from Urmia and Saqez meteorological stations, located 30 km and 185 km from the lake center, respectively. We then investigated the effect of lake level decrease on the climate variables by dividing the data into periods 1961-1995 (normal lake level) and 1996-2016 (low lake level). The results showed that at Urmia station (close to the lake), climate parameters displayed fewer fluctuations and were evidently affected by Lake Urmia compared with those at Saqez station. The effects of the lake on the local climate increased with increasing temperature, with the most significant impact in summer and the least in winter. The results also indicated that, despite decreasing lake level, local climate conditions are still influenced by Lake Urmia, but to a lesser extent. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khatibi, R</author><author>Ghorbani, M A</author><author>Naghshara, S</author><author>Aydin, H</author><author>Karimi, V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A framework for ‘Inclusive Multiple Modelling’ with critical views on modelling practices – Applications to modelling water levels of Caspian Sea and Lakes Urmia and Van</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><volume>587</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2020.124923</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083469107&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhydrol.2020.124923&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0b753836594f24dd64cda782ed868ce1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A framework is formulated in this paper for data-driven modelling practices to characterise Inclusive Multiple Modelling (IMM) practices with multiple goals of enhancing the extracted information from given datasets and learning from multiple models. This can be a shift from traditional practices with the single goal of selecting a ‘superior’ model from multiple models without a statistical justification, which may be referred to as Exclusionary Multiple Modelling (EMM) practices. The dimensions of the framework for IMM practices are: Model Reuse (MR), Hierarchy and/or Recursion (HR), a provision of ‘Elastic’ model-Learning Environment (ELE) and Goal-Orientation (GO) – leading to the acronym of RHEO. Proof-of-concept is presented for IMM-RHEO using three testcases: the Caspian Sea (19-years of data), Lake Urmia (50-years of data) and Lake Van (73-years of data), approx. 500 km apart. IMM practices are implemented by investigating four strategies for each testcase. The learning from the results includes: (i) the IMM strategies are capable of enhancing the accuracy of predicted water levels; (ii) the accuracy of predicting the sea-state of the Caspian Sea serves confidence building on accuracy; and (iii) the time-length of the record of Lake Van is long enough for the confidence building on the study of possible trends. IMM serves a bottom-up learning opportunity for Lake Urmia that its distressed state is due to being deprived of compensation flows without contributions from climate change. Arguably, a good management policy is the key for its restoration. IMM is at its infancy but arguably, its potential application areas are wide. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghaebi, H</author><author>Rostamzadeh, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Performance comparison of two new cogeneration systems for freshwater and power production based on organic Rankine and Kalina cycles driven by salinity-gradient solar pond</title><secondary-title>Renewable Energy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Renewable Energy</full-title></periodical><pages>748-767</pages><volume>156</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.renene.2020.04.043</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084118817&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.renene.2020.04.043&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=394aeae20fe376df17de30d85e573451</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Solar energy can be stored and used via employment of SGSP (salinity-gradient solar pond) for low- and medium-temperature applications. Capturing thermal heat of a SGSP for cogeneration of electricity and freshwater for residential applications can lead to outstanding outcomes. To address this need, theoretical analysis of two cogeneration systems driven by a SGSP under the same conditions is carried out to produce freshwater and electricity by integrating an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) and a Kalina cycle (KC) with a reverse osmosis (RO) desalination unit. Also, a thermoelectric generator (TEG) with a heat exchanger is used as a potential device to improve performance of the systems in order to generate more power, using heat from upper convective zone. The energy and exergy balance equations are employed to different components of the systems for the Urmia lake in Iran, and the findings are credited by the available numerical and experimental data. The results of simulation demonstrated that the SGSP-ORC/RO system can provide freshwater and net electricity of 4 m3/h and 29.6 kW, respectively, when R600a is used in the ORC, while the SGSP-KC/RO system can produce freshwater and net output electricity of 3.3 m3/h and 15.5 kW, respectively. Under this condition, the cogeneration-based Gain-Output-Ratio (CGOR) and exergy efficiency for the SGSP-ORC/RO system are calculated 8.3 and 47.2%, respectively, whereas the CGOR and exergy efficiency for the SGSP-KC/RO system are calculated 6.9 and 26.0%, respectively. At last, a comprehensive parametric study is carried out to provide a technical enlightenment for designers of the systems. In comparison with the previous model, where a flat plate collector (FPC) with surface area of 21110 m2 was used to produce 145.8 [Formula presented] fresh water, it is found that the same fresh water amount can be attained with a solar pond with 35500 m2, hence obviously increasing pond area from this value will increase fresh water capacity of the proposed plant. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pirsa, S</author><author>Asadzadeh, F</author><author>Karimi Sani, I</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Synthesis of Magnetic Gluten/Pectin/Fe3O4 Nano-hydrogel and Its Use to Reduce Environmental Pollutants from Lake Urmia Sediments</title><secondary-title>Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Inorganic and Organometallic Polymers and Materials</full-title></periodical><pages>3188-3198</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10904-020-01484-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080988031&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs10904-020-01484-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=20bdc4863295ae85e6e7679ff311af5d</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The aim of this study was to synthesize Fe3O4 nanoparticles and gluten/pectin/Fe3O4 composite hydrogel. This nano-hydrogel was then used to reduce sediment contamination in Lake Urmia (Iran). For this purpose, magnetic nanoparticles were chemically synthesized. Two types of composite Hydrogels including gluten/Fe3O4 and gluten/pectin/Fe3O4 composites were prepared by adding Fe3O4 nanoparticles and pectin to wheat gluten. The properties of Hydrogels were studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared and X-ray diffraction methods. SEM results showed that Fe3O4 particles were seed shape (30–60 nm). The results confirmed the physical interactions between magnetic nanoparticles, pectin and gluten. Subsequently, the prepared Hydrogels were used to reduce the pollution of Lake Urmia sediments. Central composite design was used to investigate the effect of interaction time and interaction temperature of hydrogel with sediment and the type of hydrogel. Qualitative characteristics of the sediments, including heavy metal concentrations (arsenic, barium, cadmium, lead, mercury and chromium), biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand COD, and organic compounds were investigated before and after treatment of sediments with hydrogel. The effect of hydrogel on enhancing sediment quality was investigated. The results showed that in the optimum condition removal efficiency of total heavy metals was 62% and removal efficiency of total organic compounds was 42%. The results also showed that gluten/pectin/Fe3O4 hydrogel had better performance in reducing environmental pollutants of sediment than wheat gluten/Fe3O4 hydrogel. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Binandeh, A</author><author>Glascock, M D</author><author>Oga, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Origin of obsidian tools from Ubaid and Rick Abad in Little Zab basin, Northwestern Iran</title><secondary-title>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Archaeological Science: Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>32</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jasrep.2020.102395</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084605869&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jasrep.2020.102395&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4f1a44fe43cb4a798b96bb0fd4e06646</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Decades of obsidian provenance studies have been conducted in different areas of northwestern Iran.

It has been hypothesized that the drying of Lake Urmia has caused by climate variation and a climate-derived increase in droughts. Therefore, it is necessary to understand the teleconnections between the interannual to multidecadal climate variability and Lake Urmia because of the tangible implications for water resource management and policy decisions in the region. In this study, we use singular spectrum analysis (SSA), wavelet coherence analysis, and lag correlation calculations to analyze and quantify the impacts of the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) on hydro-climate variables of precipitation, temperature, lake level, groundwater fluctuations, soil moisture, vegetation coverage, and insolation clearness index in the Lake Urmia watershed. Overall, the results indicate that climate oscillations attributed to the Pacific Ocean (i.e., ENSO and PDO) have a more powerful influence than Atlantic Ocean oscillations (NAO and AMO) on the variability in the water level of Lake Urmia as well as on other hydro-climate variables, except for temperature that appears influenced by the Atlantic Ocean oscillations, particularly AMO. PDO is the first dominant mode of variability in all the hydro-climate variables (63.46% on average), except for the temperature. Overall, the wavelet coherence analysis findings indicate relatively greater PDO influence than ENSO on variability in the precipitation, soil moisture, vegetation coverage, and insolation clearness index. Furthermore, hydro-climate variables in the area have a relatively highest statistical correlation with PDO (0.69 on average, ranging from 0.54 to 0.78) compared to ENSO, NAO, and AMO. Moreover, a moderate coherence between PDO and the groundwater levels in most adjacent aquifers has occurred at the &gt;8-year period from ~1980 to 2015. In general, the hydro-climate variables statistically have a weak lag correlation with NAO (0.19 on average, ranging from 0.13 to 0.24). AMO comprises the first mode variability in temperature (71.77%), and its coherence with temperature is moderate (~0.5) at &gt;16-year period for the time earlier than 2000. The lag correlation between AMO and temperature (0.66) is relatively near strong. These findings have important implications for decision-makers and scientists to improve water resources planning and operations in Lake Urmia under future climate uncertainty. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Saatloo, S M E</author><author>Siosemarde, M</author><author>Hosseini, S A</author><author>Rezaei, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Variability assessment of simulated recharge resulted from precipitation using different GCMs, case study: west shore of Lake Urmia, Iran</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>14</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-05567-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087565872&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-05567-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=82a4162fc43d69a53defce43ac91a3a8</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Variations associated with recharge rate prediction are studied by a comparison between the simulated recharge based on weather data generated by Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG), which is a downscaling model with spectra of global circulation models (GCMs). The study area included aquifer of Urmia Plain (West Shore of Lake Urmia) located in Iran, Middle East. The aquifer area was classified based on soil composition gradation. Hydrologic Evaluation of Landfill Performance (HELP) model and percolation into vertical column were used for 1-dimensional modelling (pseudo-2-D modelling) of the recharge of various zones of Urmia Plain. The data required for modelling of weather parameter and recharge include average daily temperature, daily rainfall, and solar radiation. The recharge modelling was performed for time periods of 2020–2040, 2041–2060, 2061–2080, and 2081–2100 and five GCMs based on the 5th report issued by Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), namely, EC-EARTH, GFDL-CM3, HadGEM2, MIROC5, and MPI-ESM-MR, under RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5 scenarios. The recharge results of periods were compared between the GCMs. This variability in recharge prediction indicated that GCMs are highly important tools for water management planning. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sattari, M T</author><author>Shaker Sureh, F</author><author>Kahya, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monthly precipitation assessments in association with atmospheric circulation indices by using tree-based models</title><secondary-title>Natural Hazards</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Natural Hazards</full-title></periodical><pages>1077-1094</pages><volume>102</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11069-020-03946-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085102123&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11069-020-03946-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d7cd127b70b664aa1bc8a24d74193dbc</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Urmia Lake basin is one of the most important basins in Iran, facing many problems due to poor water management and rainfall reduction. Under current circumstances, it becomes critical to have an advanced understanding of rainfall patterns in the basin, setting the motivation of this study. In this research, the mean monthly meteorological data of six synoptic stations of Urmia Lake basin were used (including relative humidity, temperature, minimum–maximum temperature and pressure) and large-scale atmospheric circulation indices (Southern Oscillation Index, North Atlantic Oscillation, Western Mediterranean Oscillation, Mediterranean Oscillation-Gibraltar/Israel and Mediterranean Oscillation-Algiers/Cairo) and sea surface temperatures of the Mediterranean, Black, Caspian, Red seas and Persian Gulf in the period 1988–2016. Various combinations of these variables used as input to the M5 tree and random forest models were selected by Relief algorithm for each month in three scenarios including atmospheric circulation indices, meteorological variables and combination of both. After the implementation of two models with three different scenarios, the evaluation criteria including correlation coefficient (R), mean absolute error and root-mean-square error were calculated and the Taylor diagram for each model was plotted. Our results showed that the M5 tree model performed superior in January, February, March, April, June, September, November and December, while the random forest model did in the remaining months. In addition, the indications of this study showed that the combination of atmospheric circulation indices and meteorological variables used as input to the models mostly constituted improved results. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zeynoddin, M</author><author>Bonakdari, H</author><author>Ebtehaj, I</author><author>Azari, A</author><author>Gharabaghi, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A generalized linear stochastic model for lake level prediction</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>723</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.138015</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082006825&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2020.138015&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=c9bd100bca4a7f9747d2ef4999016f38</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Endorheic lakes are one of the most important factors of an environment. Regarding their morphology, these lakes, in particular saline lakes, are much more sensitive and can either benefit or pose a threat to their surroundings. Thus, constant monitoring of such lakes' water level, modeling and analyzing them for future planning and management policies is vitally important. We proposed a generalized linear stochastic model (GLSM) for forecasting the weekly and monthly Urmia lake water levels, the sixth-largest saltwater lake on Earth. In this methodology, three approaches are defined to pre-process data. The first approach is merely based on the differencing method, while the second and third are a one-step (the combination of de-trending with standardization and spectral analysis) and two-step (the combination of the 2nd approach with normalization transform) preprocessing, respectively. A thorough comparison of the GLSM results with eminence nonlinear AI models (Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference Systems, ANFIS, Multilayer Perceptron, MLP, Gene Expression Programming, GEP, Support Vector Machine with Firefly algorithm, SVM-FFA, and Artificial Neural Networks ANN) showed that by using an appropriate method that delivers accurate information of the entailing terms in time series, it is possible to model Urmia lake level with acceptable precision. Concisely, the GSLM with coefficients of determination (R2) 99.957% and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 2.121% outperformed the SVM-FFA with R2 99.59%, RMSE 3.27%, ANN with R2 99.56%, RMSE 3.3%, ANFIS with R2 98.9%, RMSE 4.3%, GP with R2 99.89%, RMSE 3.47%, GEP with R2 94.75%, RMSE 4.15% for forecasting weekly time series. In forecasting monthly time series, the GLSM method with R2 99.517% and RMSE 6.91% also outperformed GEP R2 91.95%, RMSE 15.3%, ANFIS R2 92.85%, RMSE 47.55% models. Consequently, GSLM proved that by applying proper comprehensible linear techniques promising results can be obtained rather than using sophisticated AI methods. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pouladi, P</author><author>Afshar, A</author><author>Molajou, A</author><author>Afshar, M H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Socio-hydrological framework for investigating farmers’ activities affecting the shrinkage of Urmia Lake; hybrid data mining and agent-based modelling</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Sciences Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Sciences Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>1249-1261</pages><volume>65</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02626667.2020.1749763</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084324942&amp;doi=10.1080%2F02626667.2020.1749763&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8f3c17916e5f7854e403442a8281c554</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Developing a general framework to capture the complexities associated with the non-linear and adaptive nature of farmers facing water resources scarcity is a challenging problem. This paper integrates agent-based modelling (ABM) and a data mining method to develop a hybrid socio-hydrological framework to provide future insights for policy-makers. The data associated with the farmers’ main characteristics were collected through field surveys and interviews. Afterwards, the association rule was employed to discover the main patterns representing the farmers’ agricultural decisions. The discovered patterns were then used as the behavioural rules in ABM to simulate the agricultural activities. The proposed framework has been was applied to explore the interactions between agricultural activities and the main river feeding the Urmia-Lake, Iran. The outcomes indicate that farmers’ acquisitive traits and belongings have significant impacts on their socio-hydrological interactions. The reported values of the efficiency criteria may support the satisfactory performance of the proposed framework. © 2020, © 2020 IAHS.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nhu, V.-H.</author><author>Mohammadi, A</author><author>Shahabi, H</author><author>Shirzadi, A</author><author>Al-Ansari, N</author><author>Ahmad, B B</author><author>Chen, W</author><author>Khodadadi, M</author><author>Ahmadi, M</author><author>Khosravi, K</author><author>Jaafari, A</author><author>Nguyen, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Monitoring and assessment of water level fluctuations of the lake urmia and its environmental consequences using multitemporal landsat 7 etm+ images</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health</full-title></periodical><pages>1-18</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/ijerph17124210</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086440341&amp;doi=10.3390%2Fijerph17124210&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d73bced7170cf16decc650b5b30a61d8</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The declining water level in Lake Urmia has become a significant issue for Iranian policy and decision makers. This lake has been experiencing an abrupt decrease in water level and is at real risk of becoming a complete saline land. Because of its position, assessment of changes in the Lake Urmia is essential. This study aims to evaluate changes in the water level of Lake Urmia using the space-borne remote sensing and GIS techniques. Therefore, multispectral Landsat 7 ETM+ images for the years 2000, 2010, and 2017 were acquired. In addition, precipitation and temperature data for 31 years between 1986 and 2017 were collected for further analysis. Results indicate that the increased temperature (by 19%), decreased rainfall of about 62%, and excessive damming in the Urmia Basin along with mismanagement of water resources are the key factors in the declining water level of Lake Urmia. Furthermore, the current research predicts the potential environmental crisis as the result of the lake shrinking and suggests a few possible alternatives. The insights provided by this study can be beneficial for environmentalists and related organizations working on this and similar topics. © 2020 by the authors.

Overuse of its water resources has caused its water level to drop, particularly in the east shore of that lake. This consequence has caused a serious environmental risk, but created a rare opportunity to investigate the spatial distribution of six iron forms and features, i.e., total iron (Fet); dithionite-extractable iron (Fed); oxalate-extractable iron (Feo); crystalline iron (Fed-Feo); activity ratio (Feo/Fed) and crystallinity ratio (Fed-Feo/Fet). In total, 130 soil samples were taken from three strata based on their proximity to the lake. Spectral indices derived from Landsat-8 OLI imagery acquired in July 2017 were used as environmental covariates in spatial models using Random Forests (RF) technique. The calibrated RF model for 2017 allowed us to backcast data for 2013 and 2015. The results showed that the iron forms and features varied primarily as a function of distance from the shore. Soil ripening process was also demonstrated in the east shore of Urmia Lake. Overall, this study showed the possibility of a combination of spectral imageries and spatial models to predict the dynamic environment of iron forms. © 2020</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shirmohammadi, B</author><author>Malekian, A</author><author>Salajegheh, A</author><author>Taheri, B</author><author>Azarnivand, H</author><author>Malek, Z</author><author>Verburg, P H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Impacts of future climate and land use change on water yield in a semiarid basin in Iran</title><secondary-title>Land Degradation and Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Land Degradation and Development</full-title></periodical><pages>1252-1264</pages><volume>31</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ldr.3554</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078890864&amp;doi=10.1002%2Fldr.3554&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=148df797a6aa42d5d3942db9694d0f5b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Studying the interaction between hydrology, land use, and climate change is necessary to support sustainable water resources management. It is unknown how land management interventions in dry climate conditions can benefit water yield in the context of climate and land use change interactions. In this study, we assessed the effects of both land use and predicted climate change on the Mordagh Chay basin water yield using the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs model. First, we modeled the current water yield, followed by developing six combined climate–land use scenarios until 2030 based on the CCSM4 climate model for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. We used three future land use scenarios simulated by the Dyna-CLUE model. The trend scenario of land use change, which does not include any improvements in irrigation efficiency, significantly affected basin water yield under both climate scenarios. Water yield decreases by 19.8% and 31.8% for the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively. Under all land use scenarios that included improvements in irrigation efficiency, the water yield responded positively. For the RCP4.5 scenario, the water yield was projected to increase between 16.6% and 18% depending on the land use scenario. The increase in water yield under the RCP8.5 climate scenario was much lower than for the RCP4.5 scenario (about one-third). Overall, the results showed that by adopting appropriate irrigation efficiency, it is possible to achieve a better balance between environmental needs and regional economic and agricultural development. The results provide insight into possible sustainable development options and also provide guidance for managing the other Urmia Lake sub-basins, whereas the approach of integrated assessment of climate, land use change, and land management options is also applicable in other conditions to help inform sustainable management. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahmani-Rezaeieh, A</author><author>Mohammadi, M</author><author>Danandeh Mehr, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Climate change impacts on floodway and floodway fringe: a case study in Shahrchay River Basin, Iran</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-05444-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086587439&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-05444-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9b13f501a6d75f5602e4d449453eb7f1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study evaluates the impacts of climate change on the floodway and floodway fringe along the Shahrchi River located at Lake Urmia Basin, Iran. The raw historical (1971–2000) and near future (2021–2050) precipitation and temperature data were obtained from Middle East and North Africa domain of the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The projections from the global climate model were corrected using daily observations from in situ stations and then used as inputs for SWAT+ hydrological model to forecast daily streamflow under the representative concentration pathway 8.5 (RCP8.5) scenario at the near future period. Flood frequency analysis at each period was accomplished and floodway and floodway fringe were obtained through flood wave routing along the river and a multi-criteria decision-making approach, respectively. The results indicated that the climate model typically underestimates the temperature and precipitation values at the historical period and the future projections need to be adjusted. In addition, a significant decrease in total runoff volume in the future periods is expected; however, the hydrologic models showed that the number and magnitude of peak flows would be increased. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Balkanlou, K R</author><author>Müller, B</author><author>Cord, A F</author><author>Panahi, F</author><author>Malekian, A</author><author>Jafari, M</author><author>Egli, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatiotemporal dynamics of ecosystem services provision in a degraded ecosystem: A systematic assessment in the Lake Urmia basin, Iran</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>716</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.137100</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079164898&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2020.137100&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bef239b797bab9cc766bae8d67760151</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lake Urmia has experienced severe environmental degradation, mainly characterized by the enormous reduction of its surface area and water level. This issue has been mainly attributed to land-use and land-cover changes, in particular related to agricultural expansion and intensification. In this study, we used the DPSIR framework (D: driving forces, P: pressures, S: states, I: impacts, and R: responses) to systematically describe the ecosystem service dynamics related to anthropogenic activities and climatic parameters in the region. We reviewed the literature and used remote sensing, agricultural, climatic and hydrological data together with expert knowledge to assess the main driving forces and pressures, resulting land-use transitions and their spatiotemporal impacts on ecosystem services and biodiversity using a matrix-based assessment approach. We identified population growth, economic incentives and climate change as the most important driving forces, leading to altered agricultural activities, numerous dam constructions and droughts. Since 1987 cropland areas doubled at the expense of bare soils and natural vegetation, the lake hast lost more than half of its surface area, urban and freshwater areas increased threefold and by 50%, respectively. This favored crop and freshwater provision, while all other ecosystem services remained nearly constant or decreased, though spatial patterns were heterogeneous. For example, regulating and cultural services, and biodiversity mainly decreased at the shorelines of the lake, while provisioning services increased along the major rivers and close to cities. To address the land-use transitions with the most profound impact on ecosystem service provision, we recommend the following measures: increase the water supply to the lake, reduce cropland expansion, manage existing croplands more sustainably and protect natural vegetation. Our study provides a comprehensive overview of the regional ecosystem service dynamics and a valuable baseline for future research and environmental management in the basin. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mosaferi, M</author><author>Jahani Moghaddam, H</author><author>Shaker Khatibi, M</author><author>Esmat Saatloo, S M</author><author>Nemati Mansour, S</author><author>Nazmara, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial variation and quantitative screening level assessment of human risk from boron exposure in groundwater resources of western edge of the Lake Urmia, Iran</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Environmental Health Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Environmental Health Research</full-title></periodical><pages>237-250</pages><volume>30</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/09603123.2019.1590539</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85063149210&amp;doi=10.1080%2F09603123.2019.1590539&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bb818492a55aa10d8445d84b99ad2063</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Boron is a ubiquitous element and exposure to high concentrations of boron in drinking water may lead to health outcomes.

The mean boron concentration in 121 drinking water sources from 301 villages obtained 1477 ± 1683 μg/L. In the west of Urmia lake and northwestern parts of the lake (east of Salmas city), boron concentrations were up to twice the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.

It poses a high threat to soil productivity in agricultural lands. The demand for economic and rapid detection and temporal monitoring of soil salinity has been rising recently. Satellite imagery and remote sensing approaches are the significant tools for accurate prediction and mapping of soil salinity in various regions of the world. This study aims to compare Landsat- 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A derived soil salinity maps of the western part of Urmia Lake in Iran by applying three different salinity indices in conjunction with field measurements. Totally 70 soil samples were collected from top 20 cm of surface soil in October 2016 from an area of 18 km2. Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A images were acquired in the same month; both images were atmospherically and radiometrically corrected prior to applying soil salinity indices. After comparing Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) value of corresponding pixel for each sample with its electrical conductivity (EC) value, 54 soil samples with various EC ranges were selected for mapping. Among them, 42 samples were used for establishing the regression model and remaining 12 samples were utilized to validate the model. Multiple and linear regression analyses were conducted to correlate the EC data with their corresponding soil salinity spectral index values derived from visible bands of satellite images. The results revealed that soil salinity indices extracted from both Landsat-8 OLI and Sentinel-2A visible bands estimated soil salinity with acceptable accuracy of R2 0.73 and 0.74, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis using both Landsat- 8 OLI and Sentinel-2A data demonstrated higher accuracy with R2 value of 0.77 and 0.75, respectively, compared to linear regression. This study proves that various soil salinity classes with different EC ranges can be estimated by correlating ground measurement data with satellite data. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dinpashoh, Y</author><author>Babamiri, O</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Trends in reference crop evapotranspiration in Urmia Lake basin</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-05404-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085054667&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-05404-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=664aa03c95553a4eb9e85231f9d95638</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Evapotranspiration is one of the main important components of hydrologic cycle. Trend analysis of reference crop evapotranspiration (ET0) provides useful information for understanding the crop water requirements associated with climate change. In this study, monotonic trends were analyzed in monthly, seasonal, and annual timescales at the nine stations selected from Urmia Lake basin. The Mann-Kendall method was used for trend detection. Significant autocorrelation coefficients were taken into account in analysis using the modified version of Mann-Kendall method. In order to estimate the slope of trend line, the Sen’s estimator method was used. The ET0 values estimated using the standard recommended form of the FAO-56 Penman-Monteith. The results showed that more than 66.6% of the annual ET0 time series had positive trends which were significant at 0.10 level. The highest slope of annual ET0 trends belonged to the station Marageh, which was equal to 17.34 mm/year. In the seasonal scale, all of the sites (except Tekab) exhibited significant upward trends for spring season in 0.1 level. In the monthly timescale, unless 6.5% of the tested time series, all of them had downward trends. Analysis of the impacts of climatic variables on trends in ET0 showed that the reason for increasing trends in ET0 was attributed to the increasing trends in both mean air temperature and wind speed, as well as the decreasing trend in the mean relative humidity. Wise use of fresh water in this fragile ecosystem is recommended for future sustainable agricultural activities. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kheirfam, H</author><author>Asadzadeh, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Stabilizing sand from dried-up lakebeds against wind erosion by accelerating biological soil crust development</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Soil Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Soil Biology</full-title></periodical><volume>98</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ejsobi.2020.103189</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083428172&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.ejsobi.2020.103189&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6856c2de213b54e7897b895ae2a8d7fc</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Land degradation and the resulting desertification often lead to sand flowing from deserts and/or dried-up lakebeds and into habitable zones; a problem that has intensified in recent decades. We cultivated locally collected biological soil crust (BSC) bacteria (Bacillus subtilis strain) and cyanobacteria (Nostoc sp. and Oscillatoria sp.) from the dried-up bed of Lake Urmia, northwest Iran. To evaluate the ability of BSC to stabilize the sandy lakebed soil, bacteria and cyanobacteria were used to inoculate experimental trays of sandy soil from the same area, under laboratory conditions. After 120 days, we simulated winds at a speed of 72 km h−1 for three 10-min intervals (30 min in overall) to measure the sand transport rate as well as the durability and fragility of the BSCs during the wind erosion process, using an open circuit wind tunnel. We found that the bacteria, cyanobacteria, and cyanobacteria + bacteria inoculation reduced the sand flowing by 42.3, 96.6, and 95.9%, respectively, as compared to the control. We found that in addition to creating a protective cover on the soil surface, cyanobacteria created a strong bond between the soil particles through their exudation of exopolysaccharides and network of filaments, increasing the ability of the sand to withstand wind forces. Our inoculation technique was an effective and natural way to stabilize moving sand. Future research should replicate our methods under natural conditions to evaluate the potential for large-scale restoration. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Malakootian, M</author><author>Mohammadi, A</author><author>Faraji, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of physicochemical parameters in drinking water resources and health risk assessment: a case study in NW Iran</title><secondary-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>79</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12665-020-08939-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083816618&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12665-020-08939-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0d682cd3fcbb9464cfd3b4267a6141bc</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Investigation of the quality of drinking water resources in terms of their effect on the human health is a vital issue. This study aimed to study physicochemical parameters in drinking water resources in NW Iran and made an effort to assess the health risk of these parameters. The study was conducted in winter, 2018 on the 16 sampling points in the vicinity of Lake Urmia, NW Iran. Heavy metals (Pb, As, Cd, Ni, Zn, and Cu) and ions (Na+, Ca2+, K+, NO3 −, SO4 2−, and Cl−) were measured by Inductively Coupled Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometer (ICP-OES) and Ion Chromatography (IC), respectively. Non-carcinogenic risk and carcinogenic risk assessments were carried out by probabilistic approach and Monte Carlo simulation, and were expressed by hazard quotient (HQ) and excess lifetime cancer risk (ELCR) criteria, respectively. The mean values of pH, turbidity, and temperature and ions were within the permissible limits for drinking water according to the recommended range by World Health Organization (WHO). HQ values indicated a reasonable non-carcinogenic risk for Zn and Ni and unacceptable risks for As, Cd, and NO3 −. ELCR levels of As were unacceptably high. Finally, it was concluded that groundwater resources in the studied area did not have an acceptable quality for drinking usages due to the risk posed by As, Cd, and NO3 −. Therefore, pollution control through finding contamination sources and water treatment are recommended before the use of water resources for drinking consumption. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hosseini-Moghari, S.-M.</author><author>Araghinejad, S</author><author>Tourian, M</author><author>Ebrahimi, K</author><author>Döll, P</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantifying the impacts of human water use and climate variations on recent drying of Lake Urmia basin: The value of different sets of spaceborne and in situ data for calibrating a global hydrological model</title><secondary-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1939-1956</pages><volume>24</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/hess-24-1939-2020</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083743336&amp;doi=10.5194%2Fhess-24-1939-2020&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=99ee0aab0e490307ddfecfcfec89cda9</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>During the last decades, the endorheic Lake Urmia basin in northwestern Iran has suffered from declining groundwater tables and a very strong recent reduction in the volume of Lake Urmia. For the case of Lake Urmia basin, this study explores the value of different locally and globally available observation data for adjusting a global hydrological model such that it can be used for distinguishing the impacts of human water use and climate variations. The WaterGAP Global Hydrology Model (WGHM) was for the first time calibrated against multiple in situ and spaceborne data to analyze the decreasing lake water volume, lake river inflow, loss of groundwater, and total water storage in the entire basin during 2003-2013. The calibration process was done using an automated approach including a genetic algorithm (GA) and non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II). Then the best-performing calibrated models were run with and without considering water use to quantify the impact of human water use. Observations encompass remote-sensing-based time series of annual irrigated areas in the basin from MODIS, monthly total water storage anomaly (TWSA) from GRACE satellites, and monthly lake volume anomalies. In situ observations include time series of annual inflow into the lake and basin averages of groundwater level variations based on 284 wells. In addition, local estimates of sectoral water withdrawals in 2009 and return flow fractions were utilized. Calibration against MODIS and GRACE data alone improved simulated inflow into Lake Urmia but inflow and lake volume loss were still overestimated, while groundwater loss was underestimated and seasonality of groundwater storage was shifted as compared to observations. Lake and groundwater dynamics could only be simulated well if calibration against groundwater levels led to an adjustment of the fractions of human water use from groundwater and surface water. Thus, in some basins, globally available satellite-derived observations may not suffice for improving the simulation of human water use. According to WGHM simulations with 18 optimal parameter sets, human water use was the reason for 52 %-57% of the total basin water loss of about 10 km3 during 2003-2013, for 39 %-43% of the Lake Urmia water loss of about 8 km3, and for up to 87 %-90% of the groundwater loss. Lake inflow was 39 %-45% less than it would have been without human water use. The study shows that even without human water use Lake Urmia would not have recovered from the significant loss of lake water volume caused by the drought year 2008. These findings can support water management in the basin and more specifically Lake Urmia restoration plans. © 2020 All rights reserved.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ahmady-Birgani, H</author><author>Ravan, P</author><author>Schlosser, J S</author><author>Cuevas-Robles, A</author><author>AzadiAghdam, M</author><author>Sorooshian, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the chemical nature of wet deposition over a major desiccated lake: Case study for Lake Urmia basin</title><secondary-title>Atmospheric Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmospheric Research</full-title></periodical><volume>234</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.atmosres.2019.104762</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074798390&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.atmosres.2019.104762&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=77c78d93d479ae8baeb35d323f494a6c</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One of the largest hyper-saline lakes in the world is Lake Urmia, which is in the northwest region of Iran. Lake Urmia has experienced extreme desiccation in recent years. This study was conducted to investigate possible impacts of aerosol emitted by Lake Urmia on rainwater properties. Rainwater samples were collected from September 2017 to September 2018 at 13 sites spanning different areas of the Lake Urmia basin. Samples were analysed for acidity/alkalinity (pH), electrical conductivity (EC), total suspended solids (TSS) and elemental composition (Na, Mg, K, Ca, Al, Fe, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Se, and Pb). The results reveal that rainwater around Lake Urmia is characterized by high concentrations of heavy metals and toxic elements (e.g., Fe, Al, Ni, Cu, Cr, Co, Ti), especially in the outer ring of the study region to the north. Chemical signatures of anthropogenic pollution were most evident at sites near populated and manufacturing centers. The average pH of rainwater was enhanced relative to other regions, with the lowest and highest values of the 13 sites being 7.7 and 8.6, respectively. Concentrations of marine elements (Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) decreased with increasing distance from Lake Urmia, suggestive of possible impacts of the lakebed's emission on rain composition via likely below-cloud scavenging. The area impacted by the marine aerosol emitted by Lake Urmia has a diameter of 30 to 40 km surrounding the shoreline. The results reveal a stronger signature of crustal species in the north owing to desiccated lakebed hotspots located in the north. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sabbagh-Yazdi, S R</author><author>GhelichKhany, L</author><author>Kalhor, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Numerical investigation of the effects of causeway opening configurations on horizontal currents of Lake Urmia</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>1885-1898</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s13762-019-02599-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076225646&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs13762-019-02599-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4b9802da8753b84111151007aec10767</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Unlike Lake Urmia, its two neighbor lakes with similar climate and size have experienced stabilized condition over the past decades. Actually, greater impact of anthropological activities, compared to climatological parameters, on hydrological and ecological systems of Lake Urmia has been stated in the literature. In this paper, the impact of a recently constructed causeway on this lake is studied using environmental impact assessment approach. This study evaluates different alternatives for future re-development plans and clearly proves the importance of preliminary environmental studies during the design development phase of infrastructure projects. The depth-averaged flow module of NASIR finite volume solver was utilized to simulate the horizontal flow patterns in Lake Urmia. Considering hydrological and meteorological parameters, different scenarios regarding location and number of causeway openings (current opening location, opening in the middle of causeway, and 2 openings) were compared to the condition before causeway construction. Discharge values of 21 streams, average monthly evaporation of 5.93 mm/day and average monthly precipitation of 0.4 m/day were considered as input data of the developed model. The simulation results showed that horizontal flow circulations occur mostly on the southern part of the lake and the causeway opening variations generally affect the form of these circulations. In the scenario with causeway and only one opening in the middle, flow circulations present the most comparability to the lake’s flow circulation pattern before causeway construction, whereas the scenario with 2 openings has the least similarities. © 2019, Islamic Azad University (IAU).</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Farahmand, N</author><author>Sadeghi, V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating Soil Salinity in the Dried Lake Bed of Urmia Lake Using Optical Sentinel-2 Images and Nonlinear Regression Models</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Indian Society of Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>675-687</pages><volume>48</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12524-019-01100-8</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85081311626&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12524-019-01100-8&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=42a22ada1fa6cc3a03cc624882c7984d</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Soil salinization is one of the serious environmental problems in arid and semiarid regions. As an effective technique for monitoring soil salinity, remote sensing (RS) technology has been widely used to estimate soil salinity in recent years. Previous studies on soil salinity mapping based on RS images adopted linear regression (LR) between the field measured of electrical conductivity (EC) and the RS data. It is expected that nonlinear regression (NLR) models improve the accuracy of soil salinity mapping over LR. The main objectives of this study are: (1) evaluation the capability of various NLR models for estimating soil salinity based on optical Sentinel-2 RS images, (2) feature selection for soil salinity estimation, and (3) updated and accurate soil salinity map production in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake. The investigated NLR models include: polynomials, rational functions, powers, exponential, gaussian, logarithmic, and sum of sinusoidal functions with different degrees. All these regression models were calibrated and evaluated separately based on 8 visible and infrared bands of the Sentinel-2 image and 17 salinity indices to estimate soil salinity in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake (Iran). The evaluation results confirmed the superiority of the NLR models over the LR model for soil salinity estimation. The polynomial degree 3 (Poly-3) based on S3 index (S3=G×RB) could predict EC value with better accuracy than the best LR model (based on narrow NIR band). The R2 and RMSE of the Poly-3 model were 0.98 and 8.16 dS/m while corresponding values of the best LR model were 0.88 and 20.85 dS/m in test samples, respectively. In general, the results show that the NLR models, along with RS data, have enough accuracy to estimate soil salinity. To compare these methods visually and estimate salt’s distribution and concentration in this area, soil salinity maps were predicted by the best NLR model (EC = 1.63 × 10 - 10× S 3 3- 9.95 × 10 - 6× S 3 2+ 0.11 × S 3 - 151.7 ) and the other linear and NLR models in the dried lake bed of Urmia Lake. © 2020, Indian Society of Remote Sensing.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Davis, K</author><author>Ghaffarzadegan, N</author><author>Grohs, J</author><author>Grote, D</author><author>Hosseinichimeh, N</author><author>Knight, D</author><author>Mahmoudi, H</author><author>Triantis, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Lake Urmia vignette: a tool to assess understanding of complexity in socio-environmental systems</title><secondary-title>System Dynamics Review</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>System Dynamics Review</full-title></periodical><pages>191-222</pages><volume>36</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/sdr.1659</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089585182&amp;doi=10.1002%2Fsdr.1659&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d3f6860e768a3c99bdd5d0e9e2d2d59b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>We introduce the Lake Urmia Vignette (LUV) as a tool to assess individuals' understanding of complexity in socio-environmental systems.

Disruption of ecological balance, destruction of biodiversity and vegetation, desertification, and storm surges are the results of lakes drying. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an integrated bi-objective sustainable water resource management model. The first objective function deals with economically optimal allocation of water to the residential, industrial, and agricultural sectors. For compliance with the requirements of sustainable development, the second objective is to maximize the amount of water allocated to the environment. For proper utilization and reuse of water resources, the location of urban wastewater treatment plants is also considered in the problem. The model is solved with data from the most important watershed in Iran, Urmia Lake. Natural and unnatural factors have dramatically reduced the amount of water intake and balance over the past two decades. The epsilon constraint is used for solving the case study model. The results show that the model can satisfy the demand of sectors, with 70 percent of the available resources. The use of this model can meet the demands of the consumer sectors, and also, it can help revitalize Urmia Lake and the ecosystem of the river in its basin. © 2020 Materials and Energy Research Center.

Data for the period 1997–2016 from 30 weather stations were selected for the analysis. To achieve similarity between stations, climate, geographical, and statistical attributes were selected. To determine the effect of each attribute, the Shannon entropy weighting method was used. The results showed that attribute weighting had a significant impact on ETp clustering. Among the groups studied, the most significant effect of weighting was observed in the statistical attributes category. Among all attributes, skewness coefficient (CS) was the most useful in determining similarity between stations. Based on the results, ULB can be divided into three homogeneous regions. Proximity of weather stations did not always indicate similarity between them, but by weighting the stations in addition to weighting the attributes, more accurate estimates of ETp in the basin were obtained. Overall, the results demonstrate potential for application of the RoI approach in regionalization of ETp, by assigning a weight to weather stations and to influencing attributes. © 2019, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vaheddoost, B</author><author>Guan, Y</author><author>Mohammadi, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Application of hybrid ANN-whale optimization model in evaluation of the field capacity and the permanent wilting point of the soils</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science and Pollution Research</full-title></periodical><pages>13131-13141</pages><volume>27</volume><issue>12</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11356-020-07868-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 14</notes><research-notes>cited By 14</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078995136&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11356-020-07868-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9523e21456776ed4f00db01b3d5bc662</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Field capacity (FC) and permanent wilting point (PWP) are two important properties of the soil when the soil moisture is concerned. Since the determination of these parameters is expensive and time-consuming, this study aims to develop and evaluate a new hybrid of artificial neural network model coupled with a whale optimization algorithm (ANN-WOA) as a meta-heuristic optimization tool in defining the FC and the PWP at the basin scale. The simulated results were also compared with other core optimization models of ANN and multilinear regression (MLR). For this aim, a set of 217 soil samples were taken from different regions located across the West and East Azerbaijan provinces in Iran, partially covering four important basins of Lake Urmia, Caspian Sea, Persian Gulf-Oman Sea, and Central-Basin of Iran. Taken samples included portion of clay, sand, and silt together with organic matter, which were used as independent variables to define the FC and the PWP. A 80–20 portion of the randomly selected independent and dependent variable sets were used in calibration and validation of the predefined models. The most accurate predictions for the FC and PWP at the selected stations were obtained by the hybrid ANN-WOA models, and evaluation criteria at the validation phases were obtained as 2.87%, 0.92, and 2.11% respectively for RMSE, R2, and RRMSE for the FC, and 1.78%, 0.92, and 10.02% respectively for RMSE, R2, and RRMSE for the PWP. It is concluded that the organic matter is the most important variable in prediction of FC and PWP, while the proposed ANN-WOA model is an efficient approach in defining the FC and the PWP at the basin scale. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feghhenabi, F</author><author>Hadi, H</author><author>Khodaverdiloo, H</author><author>van Genuchten, M T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seed priming alleviated salinity stress during germination and emergence of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)</title><secondary-title>Agricultural Water Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Agricultural Water Management</full-title></periodical><volume>231</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106022</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85077740974&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.agwat.2020.106022&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cc993a310c9d7273b91b3a2288f45879</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Seed priming is known to often alleviate salinity stress during seed emergence and subsequent crop growth. This study compares the effects of salinity stress on the germination and emergence of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) seeds untreated (control) and primed with ascorbic acid (Asc), potassium silicate (K2SiO3), proline (Pro), spermidine (Spd) and Lake Urmia saline water (LUsw). Saline water from Lake Urmia (Iran) was diluted to produce salinities with electrical conductivities (EC) of 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20 dS m−1, while distilled water (EC ≈ 0 dS m−1) was used for the control. Two independent sets of experiments were conducted. The first experiments were used to select the most effective concentration of each priming agent based on the final germination percentage (GP) and germination rate (GR). The second set of experiments aimed to analyze the measured data in terms of salinity response functions in order to quantitatively determine the most effective priming agent(s). The first experiments showed that the most effective concentrations of Spd (0.5 mM), Pro (25 mM), K2SiO3 (1.5 mM) and LUsw (100 mg L−1) mitigated the negative impacts of salinity on GR by 32, 18, 17 and 22 %, respectively. The second experiment showed that the Maas and Hoffman (1977) and van Genuchten and Hoffman (1984) salinity response functions provided effective descriptions of seedling and early growth response to salinity stress. Mean values of the salinity threshold (EC*) and the salinity at which a given trait was reduced by 50 percent (EC50) in these functions were 3.4 and 10.8 dS m−1 for the control, respectively. By comparison, the EC* values for the K2SiO3, Pro, Spd and LUsw primed seeds were 5.3, 4.5, 4.7, and 4.2 dS m−1, respectively, and the EC50 values were 12.4, 11.4, 11.9, and 9.4 dS m−1, respectively. The beneficial effects of K2SiO3 on seedling growth were more evident than those of the other priming agents. K2SiO3 had the highest effect on EC* and EC50 of the vitality index (VI), showing increases of 151 and 34 %, respectively. The highest increases of EC* and EC50 for seedling dry weight (72 and 24 %, respectively) were obtained with Spd and K2SiO3. The findings provide much insight on relieving the negative effects of salinity through cost-effective seed priming operations so as to improve the production of wheat under saline conditions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bakhshianlamouki, E</author><author>Masia, S</author><author>Karimi, P</author><author>van der Zaag, P</author><author>Sušnik, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A system dynamics model to quantify the impacts of restoration measures on the water-energy-food nexus in the Urmia lake Basin, Iran</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>708</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.134874</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 5</notes><research-notes>cited By 5</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075934339&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2019.134874&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d8f9d18c270c268e597c2c90197329d1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Water scarcity exacerbated by growing demand in different sectors has created environmental, social, and economic challenges in the Urmia Lake Basin, Iran. Tackling this problem requires an integrated approach considering the basin as an interconnected system where a change in one sector affects others. Here, a System Dynamics Model is developed to simulate the water-energy-food nexus in the Urmia Lake Basin as a holistic multi-sectoral system and to assess the impacts of proposed lake restoration measures, especially looking for trade-offs. Besides considering climate change impacts, the effect of different sets of measures including increasing irrigation efficiency, increasing return flows, inter-basin water transfers, crop land retirement, and reviving a portion of the lake on the natural resources and socio-economic state of the basin are analysed. Results show that Urmia Lake level is sensitive to climate change scenarios. A holistic restoration approach could be effective in increasing the lake level to the proposed ecological level by 2040. However, in doing so, electricity demand in the agricultural sector could grow significantly. It is shown that a 20% retirement of irrigated wheat lands to curb water demand, if coupled with a 20% increase in yield on 80% and 50% of irrigated and rain-fed fields respectively, will not reduce wheat production in the basin. The effectiveness of water demand management measures is highly dependent on continuous monitoring and enforcement, particularly in restricting growth in agricultural water consumption. This study considered all nexus sectors in a holistic way to assess the total impact of proposed measures which on paper look positive, but may have unexpected consequences such as increasing energy demand for electric pumps. In dialogue with Urmia Lake restoration practitioners, this work can feed in to inform effective decisions for the restoration of Urmia Lake. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tussupova, K</author><author>Anchita</author><author>Hjorth, P</author><author>Moravej, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Drying lakes: A review on the applied restoration strategies and health conditions in contiguous areas</title><secondary-title>Water (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/w12030749</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082703901&amp;doi=10.3390%2Fw12030749&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=891d39e8c588bd1f594bb8b5be67c6db</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Decrease of saline lakes, which comprise 44% of all available lake water, is a major concern. It additionally accelerates the desertification process of the region. Thus, various countries have taken different actions in protecting their lake water levels. The aim of this paper is to assess different strategies directed to tackle the decreased lake water levels in Lake Urmia and the Aral Sea, which split into the North Aral Sea and South Aral Sea. These are among the world's largest and fastest drying saline lakes observed in the past 50 years and have both reduced to 10% of their original size. The paper presents a thorough review of academic reports, official documents, and databases. Although the dry-up of a lake is a natural process, it has been sped up by human interventions in the hydrological cycle. Dust storms (strong winds) cause problems in the surroundings. In the case of the Aral Sea, they transmit the pollutants from the dry lake bed causing severe health issues. Various strategies were implemented to manage the socio-economic conditions caused due to the drying of lakes. The strategy implemented for the North Aral Sea was to restore the lake by reducing the water withdrawals from the Syr Darya river, which lead to increased water inflow to the sea. The suggested strategy for Lake Urmia was to restore the lake by water transfer activities from various water sources. These projects have not yet been realized. The strategy implemented for the South Aral Sea was to use a dry lake bed to diversify the economy by oil and mineral extraction along with developing a tourist industry based on the considerable interest to come and observe an ecological disaster of such monumental proportions. These findings show that there is no common best solution for this type of problem. The best fit depends on the local context and it is strongly path-dependent. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dehghani, M H</author><author>Hopke, P K</author><author>Asghari, F B</author><author>Mohammadi, A A</author><author>Yousefi, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of the decreasing level of Urmia Lake on particulate matter trends and attributed health effects in Tabriz, Iran</title><secondary-title>Microchemical Journal</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Microchemical Journal</full-title></periodical><volume>153</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.microc.2019.104434</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076026434&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.microc.2019.104434&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=f6bab8d97d3a2edb2b6266ed07525eac</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Air pollution is a problem that accumulates with urbanization and threatens human health Exposure to PM10 can result in multiple health effects. The purpose of this investigation were to identify the trends in the concentrations of PM10 in urban stations of Tabriz, Iran. One of the main problems of Tabriz results from the drying of Urmia Lake and the release of suspended particles from the lake to the urban area. There has been accelerated drying to Urmia Lake over the past decades as well as changes in the local area winds depending on season. Because of the changing PM10 concentrations, it will be useful to map the changes across the study area using geographical information system (GIS) methods. GIS was used to estimate the variations in exposure to PM10 for people living across Tabriz. In addition, health risk assessments (total mortality, cardiovascular mortality, respiratory mortality, hospital admissions cardiovascular disease, hospital admissions respiratory disease) were conducted as a function of time. Although a Mann–Kendall trend test found that PM10 concentration had decreased during the study period, there is a change in the nature of the particles when the wind direction was from the lake to the Tabriz city. Particularly during the spring and winter, the air pollution caused by PM10 becomes problematic given the effects of the hazardous particulate matter blowing from the lake to the neighboring cities, and more attention paid to the PM10. The results show that the health effects related to PM10 varied with the concentration. Therefore, the development of management strategies to reduce PM10 caused by the drying of Lake Urmia and urban traffic, especially in the central area of the city, is essential for PM10 control and improved public health. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Heydari Tasheh Kabood, S</author><author>Hosseini, S A</author><author>Heydari Tasheh Kabood, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigating the effects of climate change on stream flows of Urmia Lake basin in Iran</title><secondary-title>Modeling Earth Systems and Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Modeling Earth Systems and Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>329-339</pages><volume>6</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40808-019-00681-0</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85086745829&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs40808-019-00681-0&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8ef4a51a4c8dde0b6146c4a3485e74a2</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The stream flows lead to erosion and degradation of soil fertility, sedimentation in reservoirs and reduction in water quality of rivers. Therefore, deeper insights into these changes will help water resource managers and planners to address such challenges. This research aims to explore the effects of climate change on stream flow variation in the Urmia Lake basin as the wettest basin in Iran, which struggles with drought and diminished water level these days, under RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios using HadGEM2-ES coupled earth system model and rainfall–runoff IHACRES model during 2041–2060 period based on the LARS-WG6 statistical downscaling model. The results of evaluating observational and simulated data by LARS-WG6 downscaling model with diverse statistical indexes revealed that there was no significant difference between the simulated and observational values with a critical error of 0.5. The results of the model’s projection also suggested that the average minimum and maximum temperature of the basin would increase by 2.6 and 3.1 °C, and the rainfall would drop by 4.5% compared to the base period (1981–2010). The performance analysis of the IHACRES runoff–rainfall model demonstrated the accuracy of this model in simulating stream flow changes in the studied basin. The results of studying surface flow changes also revealed that, based on all scenarios, the stream flow would diminish in the future, and there would be an average decrease of about 5.5% at the basin level. According to the results of different scenarios, it is predicted that the Urmia Lake basin face with decreasing stream flows, declining precipitation and rising temperatures in the future. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khozeymehnezhad, H</author><author>Nazeri-Tahroudi, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyzing the frequency of non-stationary hydrological series based on a modified reservoir index</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-5226-y</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85080981308&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-5226-y&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=41fa3a419f72cb5bd2abf1c11b3622a3</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Human activities and climatic changes have caused severe changes in hydrological values in recent decade. On the other hand, extreme values such as those of flood have non-stationary properties and using its data for hydrological studies requires stationary properties, while most meteorological variables have stationary properties. Some dams established in the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) have provided an opportunity to control all hydrological variable of catchment area. In this study, extreme values were simulated and confirmed in an annual scale for hydrometric stations constructed after constructing the reservoir using modified reservoir index (MRI) in Zarinehrood basin in south of Lake Urmia. Results obtained from evaluating trend of studied values expressed that the Nezamabad (NA) hydrometric station is influenced by Shahid Kazemi and Norouzlo reservoirs among stations in the Zarinehrood basin. MRI was used to rebuild studied data. Statistical tests were used to evaluate accuracy of the method. Results of correlation coefficient between maximum flow discharge data of NA hydrometric station and upstream station showed a 53% correlation. Also, results obtained for trend of rebuild series indicated that there is no significant trend in time series. Results also showed that the two sets of time series distribute the same statistics by evaluating statistical distribution fit on rebuild maximum flow discharge and maximum flow discharge of upstream station. Results obtained from measuring MRI demonstrated high efficiency of this method in producing maximum flow discharge for stations constructed after construction of the dam. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kheirfam, H</author><author>Roohi, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Accelerating the formation of biological soil crusts in the newly dried-up lakebeds using the inoculation-based technique</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>706</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.136036</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076307948&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.scitotenv.2019.136036&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=0e2b7433cb48dcd10c9957bb29e09d86</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The disappearance of water bodies and the emergence of dry lakebeds have intensified global environmental challenges such as dust source regions and moving dunes. The rapid formation of biological soil crusts (biocrusts) in these new ecosystems can help to accelerate their sustainability. Thus, we assessed how an inoculation-based technique (IBT) could contribute to the formation of biocrusts in a simulated sandy soil profile collected from the dried region of Lake Urmia, in the northwest of Iran. To this end, a full factorial combination of native bacteria, cyanobacteria, and a combination of the two were inoculated onto an experimental soil. After 120 days, the soil surface properties were measured, and the differences between the treatments were tested. The results showed that microbial inoculation, especially cyanobacteria, accelerated the biocrusts formation and the soil surface stability. Inoculated micro-organisms improved the biocrusts indicators including carbon (225%; p &lt; 0.01) and nitrogen (3200%; p &lt; 0.01) content, available phosphorus (70%; p &lt; 0.01) and potassium (19%; p &lt; 0.05), cation exchange capacity (9.3%; p &lt; 0.05), pH (−1.2%; p &lt; 0.01), electrical conductivity (−23%; p &lt; 0.01), soil moisture (15.7%; p &lt; 0.05), bulk density (−2.5%; p &lt; 0.05), surface roughness (34.8%; p &lt; 0.01), and aggregate stability (133%; p &lt; 0.01), as compared to the non-inoculated soil. Analysis of the scanning electron microscopy images obtained from the soil surface also confirmed the ability of cyanobacteria to create strong bonding between soil particles. Overall, the IBT could be considered as a fast and eco-friendly way for creating/restoring biocrusts in newly dried-up/degraded lands. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kanani, R</author><author>Fakheri Fard, A</author><author>Ghorbani, M A</author><author>Dinpashoh, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analysis of the role of climatic and human factors in runoff variations (Case study: Lighvan river in Urmia Lake Basin, Iran)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Water and Climate Change</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Water and Climate Change</full-title></periodical><pages>291-302</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2166/wcc.2019.186</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083821103&amp;doi=10.2166%2Fwcc.2019.186&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7e88dde05de8072f60623138916a87c3</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In recent years, river flows have significantly decreased due to regional or global climate change and human activities, especially in the arid and semi-arid regions. In this study, the effects of climate change and human activities on the runoff responses were examined using hydrologic sensitivity analysis and hydrologic model simulation in the Lighvan basin located in the northwest of Iran. The Mann–Kendall test was applied to identify the trends in hydroclimatic data series. Also, the Pettitt test was used to detect change points in the annual discharge values and climatic variables. The results showed that there was negative trend in discharge data series, and examination of the climatic factors indicated that there was an increase in the temperature values and a decrease in the relative humidity values at the basin. The rapid changes in runoff values and most of the climatic variables occurred in the mid-1990s. The effect percentages of the human factors and climatic factors on runoff reduction in all the models used were 65–84% and 16–35%, respectively. Therefore, the impact of human activities on the river flow changes was significant. © 2020, IWA Publishing.

Here we present a new framework to guide eco-hydrological restoration of saline lakes and build their resilience to climate change by optimizing agricultural land use and related water withdrawals. The framework involves four steps: 1. selection of global circulation models for the basin under study; 2. establishment of a hydrological balance over the lake's area to estimate the amount of water required for its restoration; 3. water allocation modeling to determine the water available for restoration and allocation of the remaining water across different users in the lake's basin; and 4. basin-scale optimization of land use and cropping patterns subject to water availability. We illustrated the general applicability of the framework through the case of the second largest (by volume) hyper-saline lake globally, Lake Urmia, which lost 96% of its volume in only 20 years, primarily as a result of upstream water withdrawals. Through the application of the framework, we estimated the amount of water needed to restore the lake, either fully or partially, and proposed a sustainable land-use strategy, while protect farmers’ income in the basin. Considering future climate change projections under two representative concentration pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5, we found that an average annual surface inflow of 3,648 Mm3 (∼70% increase in RCP 4.5) and 3,692 Mm3 (∼73% increase in RCP 8.5) would be required to restore the lake by 2050, respectively. This would require the respective conversion of 95,600 ha and 133,687 ha of irrigated land to rain-fed cropland or grassland across the basin by 2050. The proposed framework can be used for building resilience to climate change and mitigating human-induced threats to other declining saline lakes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samadi, M T</author><author>Khorsandi, H</author><author>Bahrami Asl, F</author><author>Poorolajal, J</author><author>Tayebinia, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The effect of long-term exposures to hypersaline particles originated from drying Urmia hypersaline Lake on the increased cardiovascular risks in the villagers around the Lake</title><secondary-title>Human and Ecological Risk Assessment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Human and Ecological Risk Assessment</full-title></periodical><pages>335-348</pages><volume>26</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/10807039.2018.1508330</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85060327275&amp;doi=10.1080%2F10807039.2018.1508330&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=78b6ae155d3e0887c0a8d443bb6043e9</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background and Objectives: The world’s second largest permanent hypersaline lake, Lake Urmia, is drying in recent years and the dried bed of the Lake acts as a hypersaline particle emission source. Therefore, we aim to evaluate (for the first time to our knowledge) the association between hypersaline particles and biomarkers of inflammation and coagulation (hs-CRP and fibrinogen) in the residents around the Lake Urmia. Methods: Three regions were selected as clean (region No.1) and polluted regions (region No.2 and No.3) for ambient particulate matter around the Urmia Lake from 2008 to 2015. In order to confirm the selected regions concentration of APM was measured in the selected regions for six months. Totally 123 participants were selected randomly, fibrinogen, hs-CRP and covariates were measured in the selected regions and were analyzed using multiple linear regression models. Results: We found a statistically significant association between the hypersaline particles and fibrinogen in both polluted regions. This is while an association between hypersaline particles and hs-CRP was significant only in the polluted region No.2. Conclusions: These results are consistent with our hypothesis that long-term exposure to hypersaline particles originated from drying Urmia hypersaline Lake is related to increased levels of hs-CRP and fibrinogen. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bashirian, F</author><author>Rahimi, D</author><author>Movahedi, S</author><author>Zakerinejad, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Water level instability analysis of Urmia Lake Basin in the northwest of Iran</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-5207-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079702599&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-5207-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=e3845146bca277b1316b58528ac23918</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Water level reduction of Urmia Lake Basin is the main problem in northwest of Iran during 2001–2017. Climate change and human activity have affected the water resources in this basin. In addition, continuing downward trend of water level in the Urmia Lake leads to hazard such as dust storm, lake drying, subsidence in plains, population immigration, and reduced production efficiency. Finding the causes of water level change is one of the challenges as to the unsustainability of the lake. Climate change, drought, dam construction, well drilling, land use change, land cover change, and the pattern of cultivations are inflectional here. The results of the Man-Kendall test indicate that the annual temperature (Z = 2.3, 95%) and frequency of droughts increased, and annual precipitation (Z = − 2.5, 95%) decreased. The results indicate that groundwater extraction increased from 374 to 2263.4 mcm, and the volume of dams increased from 198 to 1758 mcm (1961–2017). Surface water is reduced due to decreasing rainfall, increasing temperature, and drought frequency in the last decade. The comparison of these parameters with each other indicates high contribution of climate change and human activity in water level reduction of the subject lake. Restoration and sustainability of this lake are very important to the water management resources of Urmia Lake Basin. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Safavi, S</author><author>Saghafian, B</author><author>Hosseini, S A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Characterizing flow pattern and salinity using the 3D MIKE 3 model: Urmia Lake case study</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>13</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-020-5095-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078168302&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-020-5095-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bfa4009945089f6f0d3857d51176f4bc</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this study, MIKE 3 model was used to simulate flow pattern and salinity distribution in Urmia Lake. About two decades ago, a causeway was constructed in the lake. The causeway has a 1.25-km opening and divides the lake into northern and southern basins. To perform the simulation, different influential variables such as the discharge of inflow rivers, wind speed, variation in water density, bed roughness, air temperature, relative humidity, cloud coverage, and heat flux through water surface were taken into account. Using the available water level data, salinity, and current velocity, the numerical model was calibrated and validated. Results revealed that the northern part of the lake was saltier due to the negligible entrance of fresh water into the northern part as well as the construction of causeway which restricts water exchange between the northern and southern parts of the lake. Results also showed that density-driven currents are dominant and that the fresher surface water layer in the southern part moves north and circulates counterclockwise in the northern portion of the lake, increasing water salinity and density. This water then moves to deeper layers and circulates back to the southern part. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fathian, F</author><author>Dehghan, Z</author><author>Eslamian, S S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of extreme quantiles at ungaged sites based on region-of-influence and weighting approaches to regional frequency analysis of maximum 24-h rainfall</title><secondary-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>1191-1205</pages><volume>139</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00704-019-03022-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075943086&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00704-019-03022-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bb84a8aa99ebf7f78bd3bd9464d8bc25</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lack of adequate and reliable data for estimating the extreme values of hydrological variables at ungaged sites has always been one of the issues facing hydrologists in designing and planning water resource projects. Regionalizing the considered hydrological variable, finding an acceptable relationship for estimating its extreme values at ungaged sites using given data of other stations, and applying their available attributes are the solutions for the mentioned issue. In this study, historical data of maximum 24-h rainfall (M24-hR) covering the statistical period of 30 years (1979–2008) were collected and used from 63 rainfall gaging stations situated at Lake Urmia basin, northwestern Iran. Afterwards, using the method of region-of-influence (ROI) regionalization, the study area was regionalized through the geographic attributes of the stations (including latitude, longitude, elevation above mean sea level, and distance to the center of Lake Urmia). Then, all possible situations were considered for providing an appropriate regression relationship to estimate the extreme quantiles of M24-hR at ungaged sites by defining various scenarios of weighting to the geographic attributes and rainfall quantiles. The results showed that among different defined weighting scenarios, weighting to both stations and attributes in the at-site situation had an effective impact on forming an appropriate regression relationship for the estimation of extreme quantiles at ungaged sites. However, in the regional situation, a scenario considering no weight for both stations and attributes resulted in the most acceptable estimation of the quantiles with the lowest error (MSE = 1.29 mm). Further, the study showed that in most scenarios, the extreme quantiles estimated by means of regional regression relationships at ungaged sites (MSE = 1.29~1.75 mm) resulted in lower errors than the at-site ones (MSE = 1.35~7.64 mm). © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Moazamnia, M</author><author>Hassanzadeh, Y</author><author>Nadiri, A A</author><author>Sadeghfam, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vulnerability Indexing to Saltwater Intrusion from Models at Two Levels using Artificial Intelligence Multiple Model (AIMM)</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><volume>255</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jenvman.2019.109871</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075793855&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jenvman.2019.109871&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=3d357d2287e5cf83753d489202ba4053</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Unplanned groundwater exploitation in coastal aquifers results in water decline and consequently triggers saltwater intrusion (SWI). This study formulates a novel modeling strategy based on GALDIT method using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models for mapping the vulnerability to SWI. This AI-based modeling strategy is a two-level learning process, where vulnerability to SWI at Level 1 can be predicted by such models as Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Sugeno Fuzzy Logic (SFL), and Neuro-Fuzzy (NF); and their outputs serve as the input to the model at Level 2, such as Support Vector Machine (SVM). This model is applied to Urmia aquifer, west coast of Lake Urmia, where both are currently declining. The construction of the above four models both at Levels 1 and 2 provide tools for mapping the SWI vulnerability of the study area. Model performances in the paper are studied using RMSE and R2 metrics, where the models at Level 1 are found to be fit-for-purpose and the SVM at Level 2 is improved particularly with respect to the reduced scale of scatters in the results. Evaluating the result and groundwater samples by Piper diagram confirms the correspondence of SWI status with vulnerability index. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fathollahi-Fard, A M</author><author>Hajiaghaei-Keshteli, M</author><author>Tian, G</author><author>Li, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An adaptive Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm for a coordinated water supply and wastewater collection network design problem</title><secondary-title>Information Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Information Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>1335-1359</pages><volume>512</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ins.2019.10.062</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 18</notes><research-notes>cited By 18</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075460631&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.ins.2019.10.062&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2d4a7e50e8af9149c07cf6326a547e62</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The last century has seen an increased prevalence and duration of droughts as well as the water shortage especially in Middle East countries like Iran. This urgent situation in Iran such as Urmia Lake in the west Azerbaijan province is a motivation for us to model a new coordinated water supply and wastewater collection network design problem. Due to the uncertainty, as one of inherent sections of the water supply chain, a two-stage stochastic programming approach is used to formulate the problem. To solve the proposed model, a Lagrangian relaxation-based algorithm formulated by a new adaptive strategy is employed. This algorithm considers both upper and lower bounds of the problem to reach a performance solution. The proposed algorithm is compared with two similar algorithms from the literature to reveal its performance. As such, the efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated by some sensitivity analyses. Finally, a comprehensive discussion is provided to show the main findings and practical insights of this research. © 2019</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arabsahebi, R</author><author>Voosoghi, B</author><author>Tourian, M J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A denoising–classification–retracking method to improve spaceborne estimates of the water level–surface–volume relation over the Urmia Lake in Iran</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Remote Sensing</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Remote Sensing</full-title></periodical><pages>506-533</pages><volume>41</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/01431161.2019.1643938</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073578678&amp;doi=10.1080%2F01431161.2019.1643938&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bbf33a8572d5c3b13cc017bca7f4de1b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Decreasing the volume of the Urmia Lake, as the largest inland water body in Iran, is one of the current environmental and water resource management concerns. This study obtains a reliable spaceborne water level (WL)–area–volume relationship for the Urmia Lake using terrestrial, aerial and satellite-based data. The aim of this study is to improve Urmia Lake’s WL derived from satellite altimetry and, consequently, to more accurately estimate the volume of the lake for the last decade. To this end, improved WL is obtained from the Satellite with Argos and Altika (SARAL/AltiKa) and Jason-2 altimetry missions by performing a post-processing method. The post-processing method includes a denoising, a classification and appropriate retracking algorithms. The results are validated against in situ gauge data and also compared with results from Prototype Innovant de Système de Traitement pour les Applications Côtières et l’Hydrologie (PISTACH) and Prototype on AltiKa for Coastal, Hydrology and Ice (PEACHI) products. The Denoising–Classification–Retracking (DCR) method improves the root mean square error (RMSE) of WL with respect to those of PISTACH and PEACHI by 54% and 24%, respectively. The surface area of the lake is determined from Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) images based on calculating normalized difference water index (NDWI). The results are validated against the surface area obtained from aerial photogrammetry and Cartosat high resolution image. Moreover, based on bathymetric map a Look-up table including surface area and volume of the lake at specific levels are formed. The obtained surface area is then compared with the values of the Look-up table. The normalized root mean square error between surface extent obtained from proposed method and corresponding values is about 11%. The estimated lake’s volume is compared with the level-volume curve from the bathymetric data. The result showed the RMSE of this comparison is about 0.12 km3. Our validated results show that the lake has lost 75% of its volume from late 2008 to early 2016 but continued with an increase in its volume in May 2017 twice as much as in early 2016. Our results support urgent or long-term restoration plan of Lake Urmia and highlight the important role of spaceborne sensors for hydrological applications. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bozorg-Haddad, O</author><author>Dehghan, P</author><author>Zareie, S</author><author>Loáiciga, H A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>System dynamics applied to water management in lakes*</title><secondary-title>Irrigation and Drainage</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Irrigation and Drainage</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ird.2470</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085136013&amp;doi=10.1002%2Fird.2470&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=67b1edffe12a896924489b7e1c033071</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Water withdrawal and changes in hydrologic fluxes have lowered the level of Urmia Lake in Iran, adversely impacting its ecosystem. The continued lowering of the Urmia Lake water level would put Iran's most important aquatic ecosystem in danger of extinction. Therefore, there is an urgent need for management of water withdrawals and for reduction of water use in upstream dams and rivers to halt its continuing decline and allow storage recovery. The Urmia Lake basin was herein modelled with system dynamics (SD) to assess the effects of modifying reservoir operation and water use management on the sustainability of Urmia Lake storage. The model performance was evaluated with the root mean square error (RMSE) and the correlation coefficient (R2). The results show that SD with RMSE = 18.0 (106 m3) and R2 = 0.952 is accurate in simulating Urmia Lake storage. Evaluation of the impacts of several scenarios of agricultural water use on lake storage indicates that reductions in the agricultural sector appear inevitable to restore the water balance of Urmia Lake. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghomashi, F</author><author>Khalesifard, H R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation and characterization of atmospheric aerosols over the Urmia Lake using the satellite data and synoptic recordings</title><secondary-title>Atmospheric Pollution Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmospheric Pollution Research</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.apr.2020.08.020</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089664644&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.apr.2020.08.020&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d09c867fb21501906a2d3c2954792ed2</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The Urmia Lake, a hypersaline lake in Northwest Iran is facing a severe drying scenario. The dried part of the lake can act as a source of salt particles that may contaminate the atmosphere of the lake and its surrounding regions. We used the CALIPSO satellite recordings on particulate depolarization ratio (PDR) and aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 532 nm as well as MODIS AOD at 550 nm during June 2006 to December 2017, to characterize the atmospheric aerosols over the Urmia Lake water catchment region. By monitoring the aerosol layer height that is retrieved from the CALIPSO recordings, we found that most of the dust layers over the Urmia Lake, are transported from the neighboring sources. The mean PDR value for the aerosol layers that are in contact with the lake surface during dry months is ~0.16 ± 0.03 but for dense dust layers, high above the mountain ranges, this is ~0.19 ± 0.04. This study shows that the Urmia Lake is a minor source of atmospheric mineral particles and is very much under the influence of other major neighboring dust sources. Even though it is not easy to distinguish between transported dust layers and particles that may originate from the lake, our investigations show that the lake is mostly active during the driest times of the year, i.e., June to September. During these times, the PDR for the aerosols that are appearing in the vicinity of the dried lake bed is very close to that of dry salt particles. © 2020 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Book">1</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zare, M</author><author>Mohammadi-Ivatloo, B</author><author>Abapour, M</author><author>Asadi, S</author><author>Mohammadi, G</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The necessity of a food-energy-water nexus approach for lake urmia basin under the risks of climate change and environment degradation</title><secondary-title>Food-Energy-Water Nexus Resilience and Sustainable Development: Decision-Making Methods, Planning, and Trade-Off Analysis</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Food-Energy-Water Nexus Resilience and Sustainable Development: Decision-Making Methods, Planning, and Trade-Off Analysis</full-title></periodical><pages>201-227</pages><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/978-3-030-40052-1_9</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089327860&amp;doi=10.1007%2F978-3-030-40052-1_9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=fdf3504129a198038510bd65cac0f7d2</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This chapter examines the nexus (interactions) of food, energy, and water at a basin scale. This framework is applied to the Lake Urmia Basin in Iran to reveal the most important conflicts derived from food, energy, and water interdependencies. Due to the absence of a mechanized irrigation system, agriculture consumes about 89% of the total freshwater withdrawals of the basin while the global average of this ratio is 70%. Also, whereas the share of food from the world’s total energy consumption is about 30%, it is only 4% for the Lake Urmia Basin. In recent decades, a dramatic reduction in the lake water level has turned a big part of the lake into a salty desert. Inefficient management is apparent in all sectors of the basin, including food, energy, water, the environment, and ecosystems. On the other hand, the region will most likely be affected by the destructive impact of climate change. Therefore, an integrated and comprehensive resource management strategy, such as food-energy-water nexus approach, is very necessary to mitigate the effects of the crisis and increase the resiliency of the society against the current and new incoming realities. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ramezani, Y</author><author>Khashei-Siuki, A</author><author>Tahroudi, M N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatial distribution of the daily, monthly, and annual precipitation concentration indices in the lake Urmia basin, Iran</title><secondary-title>Idojaras</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Idojaras</full-title></periodical><pages>73-95</pages><volume>124</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.28974/idojaras.2020.1.4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082104517&amp;doi=10.28974%2Fidojaras.2020.1.4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8d3d61acdd86ca9082a3aa56cad943e9</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Investigations of the long-term observations of climate variables, as a practical approach to monitor climate changes, have attracted the interest of many researchers around the world. One of the important variables in this context is precipitation. The investigation of precipitation, one of the most important meteorological factors directly affecting accessibility to water resources, is of special importance. In every region, studies of precipitation on daily, monthly, or annual scales provide important information on the distribution, concentration, and dispersion of precipitation, as well as some conclusions about the associated hydrological problems. In this study, the precipitation concentration was calculated and zoned by means of the precipitation concentration index (PCI) in the basin of Lake Urmia, using monthly and annual rainfall data of 42 selected rain gauge stations, from which 24 stations located in the West Azerbaijan province (in the west of Lake Urmia) and 18 stations located in the East Azerbaijan province (in the east of Lake Urmia) during 1984–2013. The results of the studies of the precipitation concentration index over the basin of Lake Urmia showed that the dominant concentrations of spring, autumn, and winter precipitation were moderate, indicating a moderate distribution for the precipitation of the months in these seasons. In addition, in the period under study, uniform and regular precipitation concentrations (PCI&lt;10) were observed only in winter and in the borders of the basin. In summer, almost the entire surface of the basin (excluding its northeastern part) faced a strongly irregular distribution of precipitation, indicating irregular rainfall in July, August, and September. Most of the basin of Lake Urmia is covered by an irregular distribution of precipitation on an annual scale. By investigating the precipitation distribution in the first and the last 10 years of the statistical period considered and by comparing them, it was revealed that the greatest increase in the precipitation concentration index was in autumn, it rose by approximately 20.55 percent. According to the results, on the basin scale, the concentration index showed that the daily rainfall of the Lake Urmia basin was neither in regular nor in strongly irregular conditions at any of the stations studied. All the stations studied were in fairly regular, moderate concentration and fairly irregular conditions of daily precipitation distribution. The results also showed that the moderate concentration includes most of the daily precipitation distributions throughout the basin. © 2020, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

As a result of climate change and human activities, the lake has been largely desiccated. Previous work around the unfolding environmental disaster mainly focused on Lake Urmia’s water regime, water level fluctuations, crisis causes and possible actions to revive its fortunes. However, there has been little discussion on the prevailing socio-economic consequences for rural livelihoods affected by the disaster. This paper investigates the impacts of the desiccation on rural households and analyses the occurrence and different forms of local villagers’ coping strategies. We present the findings of field research in the region, whereby open and semi-structured interviews, with both regional experts from different institutions and local residents, were conducted. Evidence from this study suggests that rural communities near the lake are considerably dependent on the lake basin’s ecosystem services, such as water availability, clean air, soil and local climate regulation—all of which are heavily threatened by progressive environmental degradation. In particular, tourism decline and losses in agriculture have already led to emigration to larger cities, presenting challenges for both rural and urban infrastructures. Overall, the vulnerability of rural households to the crisis was found to be high for reasons such as poverty, lack of income alternatives and a lack of institutional mitigation and adaptation policies. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghorbanalizadeh, A</author><author>Akhani, H</author><author>Bergmeier, E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vegetation patterns of a rapidly drying up salt lake ecosystem: Lake Urmia, NW Iran</title><secondary-title>Phytocoenologia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Phytocoenologia</full-title></periodical><pages>1-46</pages><volume>50</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1127/phyto/2019/0338</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85085952077&amp;doi=10.1127%2Fphyto%2F2019%2F0338&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=9fd2f6ac2a09cbfbbef80a6ef067c9bc</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Questions: What are the plant communities and vegetation pattern on shorelines of a hypersaline desiccating lake and which environmental factors influence the zonation pattern of these communities? How is the species richness along salt and moisture gradients? Which plant communities and rare species are threatened by the impact of lake shrinkage? Which advice can be offered for the management and restoration of the area? Study area: Lake Urmia, NW Iran, one of the world’s largest saltwater lakes. Methods: We established 14 transects with 174 relevés in different parts of the lake and collected soil samples. TWINSPAN was used for vegetation classification and NMDS for ordination. Results: We distinguished 27 plant communities and described as new the associations Salicornio iranicae-Bolboschoenetum affinis, Tamaricetum octandrae, Salicornietum iranicae, Climacopteretum crassae, Suaedo altissimae-Climacopteretum crassae and the Atriplici leucocladae-Caroxyle-tum dendroidis. We present an overview of the syntaxa and illustrate typical zonation patterns of the lake’s salt marsh vegetation under current conditions of desiccation. Conclusions: The vegetation pattern and vegetation dynamics of the area is seriously affected by the hydrological changes around Lake Urmia. Fragmentation of wetland plant communities due to water shortage, increasing disturbance and invasion of ruderal species affect the floristic composition of the lakeside. Increasing soil salinity and decreasing moisture lead to area loss or even disappearance of certain plant communities. Plant communities with C4 annuals or pioneer ruderal species are developing or spreading in sites with low soil salinity or on sandy soils. We strongly recommend vegetation monitoring using permanent plots to improve the predictability of succession trends. Groundwater exploita-tion, unsustainable use of water resources in the catchment area, any further disturbance in the lakeside area including grazing and artificial plantation activities need to be prohibited. © 2020 Gebrüder Borntraeger, 70176 Stuttgart, Germany.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Baygan, A</author><author>Mogaddam, M R A</author><author>Lotfipour, F</author><author>Nemati, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evaluation of heavy metals (Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, As, and Pb) concentration in salt samples of Lake Urmia, Iran</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Environmental Analytical Chemistry</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/03067319.2020.1742890</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082512177&amp;doi=10.1080%2F03067319.2020.1742890&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=56a1ba585dbf8076d1cf968509dbb139</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Heavy metals are one of the environmental pollutants that human exposure to them can cause chronic diseases. In most people, food is one of the most important sources of heavy metals. Therefore, the evaluation of heavy metals residues in various food samples and food additives like salt is of great importance. In this study, 30 salt samples were collected from 30 different locations of Lake Urmia and analysed with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy to assess the contamination of heavy metals in them. In this method, the analytes were extracted with two chelating agents. The maximum concentrations of Cd, Cr, Hg, Ni, As, and Pb in the evaluated salt samples were 40, 541, 261, 464, 38, and 254 ng g–1, respectively. Comparison of the obtained results with the Codex maximum residue limits of heavy metals in the edible salt indicated that only in two cases of the studied salt samples the concentrations of metals exceeded the recommended levels (in one sample the concentration of Cr and in another sample, the concentration of Hg). Considering the outcomes of this study and the adverse effects of heavy metals residues on human health, continuous monitoring of their levels in the salt samples of Lake Urmia is highly recommended. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor &amp; Francis Group.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shirmohammadi, B</author><author>Malekian, A</author><author>Salajegheh, A</author><author>Taheri, B</author><author>Azarnivand, H</author><author>Malek, Z</author><author>Verburg, P H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Scenario analysis for integrated water resources management under future land use change in the Urmia Lake region, Iran</title><secondary-title>Land Use Policy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Land Use Policy</full-title></periodical><volume>90</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.landusepol.2019.104299</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85074019912&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.landusepol.2019.104299&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=574ba1600a9aef29988fac616d7236de</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Arid and semi-arid regions are particularly vulnerable to global environmental change because of their fragile climatic conditions. The rapid development of land use is expected to affect aquatic ecosystems in these regions. In this study, we focused on how land use change affects the stream flow and inflow to Urmia Lake in the Mordagh Chay basin, Iran. This case-study exemplifies dynamics found across a much larger region. We mapped changes in land use between 1993–2015 using satellite imagery and modeled future changes using the Dyna-CLUE model. We projected future land use change until 2030 under four scenarios: continuing of the current trend of water use, 40% water withdrawal reduction, and two other scenarios with 40% water withdrawal reduction and improvements of irrigation efficiency up to 50% and 85%. Between 1993–2015, 21% of the study area changed to orchard and arable land mostly at the cost of rangeland. However, upon reduction of water withdrawal our analyses showed that garden must decrease between 27% and 40%. Rainfed cropland is projected to experience a major increase in all scenarios, especially in the case of reduced water withdrawal, where it will increase by 217%. In order to achieve sustainable water resources management land use plays a major role and leads to different land use futures in this type of semi-arid regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bui, D T</author><author>Asl, D T</author><author>Ghanavati, E</author><author>Al-Ansari, N</author><author>Khezri, S</author><author>Chapi, K</author><author>Amini, A</author><author>Pham, B T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Effects of inter-basinwater transfer on water flow condition of destination basin</title><secondary-title>Sustainability (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sustainability (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/SU12010338</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084242703&amp;doi=10.3390%2FSU12010338&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2463ecbddb5081e6dd6220db822f7d64</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In recent years, the intensification of drought and unsustainable management and use of water resources have caused a significant decline in the water level of the Urmia Lake in the northwest of Iran. This condition has affected the lake, approaching an irreversible point such that many projects have been implemented and are being implemented to save the natural condition of the Urmia Lake, among which the inter-basin water transfer (IBWT) project from the Zab River to the lake could be considered an important project. The main aim of this research is the evaluation of the IBWT project effects on the Gadar destination basin. Simulations of the geometrical properties of the river, including the bed and flow, have been performed, and the land cover and flood map were overlapped in order to specify the areas prone to flood after implementing the IBWT project. The results showed that with the implementation of this project, the discharge of the Gadar River was approximately tripled and the water level of the river rose 1 m above the average. In April, May, and June, about 952.92, 1458.36, and 731.43 ha of land adjacent to the river (floodplain) will be inundated by flood, respectively. Results also indicated that UNESCO's criteria No. 3 (&quot;a comprehensive environmental impact assessment must indicate that the project will not substantially degrade the environmental quality within the area of origin or the area of delivery&quot;) and No. 5 (&quot;the net benefits from the transfer must be shared equitably between the area of origin and the area of water delivery&quot;) have been violated by implementing this project in the study area. The findings could help the local government and other decision-makers to better understand the effects of the IBWT projects on the physical and hydrodynamic processes of the Gadar River as a destination basin. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Behravesh, M</author><author>Mirzaei, M</author><author>Mohebalhojeh, A R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of mechanical and thermal effects of lake urmia: a case study</title><secondary-title>Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Meteorology and Atmospheric Physics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00703-020-00742-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85084117797&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00703-020-00742-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=023235c73a0fb3b45655f911bf9877c0</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Simulation of the lakes’ impact on precipitation and the quantification of the effects resulting from the contribution of different processes have proved challenging in numerical weather prediction. Lakes have differences with their surrounding lands in roughness, surface temperature and humidity content, which are the root causes of the mechanical and thermal mechanisms that lead to changes in the amount of precipitation in the downwind of a lake. In this study, the effect of Lake Urmia on precipitation in the form of snowfall is simulated for a case of heavy precipitation associated with severe weather across a significant part of the Southwest Asia on 11 Dec. 2013 using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model coupled with the Community Land Model (CLM) in simulations with and without the lake. The results illustrate that omitting the lake reduces the humidity content and precipitable water in the vertical column above the lake. In this case, however, the role of mechanical effect due to differences in roughness between the lake and its surrounding lands is noticeably larger than the thermal effect due to differences in the moisture and heat supplied by the lower surface to the air masses above. Associated with the roughness differences, a distinct change in the location of the convergence line of the antithetical currents is identified over the lake. The case highlights the importance of the proper representation of surface characteristics in mesoscale models to gain improvements on the fine-scale details of precipitation. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khan, S A</author><author>Vahed, S Z</author><author>Forouhandeh, H</author><author>Tarhriz, V</author><author>Chaparzadeh, N</author><author>Hejazi, M A</author><author>Jeon, C O</author><author>Hejazi, M S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Halomonas urmiana sp.

The bacterium was isolated from a water specimen and designated as TBZ3T. Colonies were found to be creamy yellow, with catalase-and oxidase-positive activities. The growth of strain TBZ3T was observed to be at 10–45 °C (optimum, 30 °C), at pH 6.0–9.0 (optimum, pH 7.0) and in the presence of 0.5–20 % (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 7.5 %). Strain TBZ3T contained C16: 0, cyclo-C19: 0 ω8c, summed feature 3 (comprising C16: 1 ω7c and/or C16: 1 ω6c) and summed feature 8 (comprising C18: 1 ω7c and/or C18: 1 ω6c) as major fatty acids and ubiquinone-9 as the only respiratory isoprenoid quinone. Diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidy-lethanolamine, glycolipid, unidentified phospholipid and unidentified polar lipids were detected as the major polar lipids. Strain TBZ3T was found to be most closely related to Halomonas saccharevitans AJ275T, Halomonas denitrificans M29T and Halomonas sediminicola CPS11T with the 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities of 98.93, 98.15 and 97.60 % respectively and in phylogenetic analysis strain TBZ3T grouped with Halomonas saccharevitans AJ275T contained within a large cluster within the genus Halo-monas. Based on phenotypic, chemotaxonomic and molecular properties, strain TBZ3T represents a novel species of the Halo-monas genus, for which the name Halomonas urmiana sp. nov. is proposed.

The task is more difficult in arid and semiarid regions. Addressing these issues, the present paper introduces a hybrid machine learning model, namely multiple genetic programming (MGP), that improves the predictive accuracy of the standalone genetic programming (GP) technique when used for 1-month ahead rainfall forecasting. The new model uses a multi-step evolutionary search algorithm in which high-performance rain-borne genes from a multigene GP solution are recombined through a classic GP engine. The model is demonstrated using rainfall measurements from two meteorology stations in Lake Urmia Basin, Iran. The efficiency of the MGP was cross-validated against the benchmark models, namely standard GP and autoregressive state-space. The results indicated that the MGP statistically outperforms the benchmarks at both rain gauge stations. It may reduce the absolute and relative errors by approximately up to 15% and 40%, respectively. This significant improvement over standalone GP together with the explicit structure of the MGP model endorse its application for 1-month ahead rainfall forecasting in practice. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Falaki Ilkhchi, Q</author><author>Ahmadi, H</author><author>Hesari, B</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Generation of climate change scenarios for precipitation and maximum temperature at local scales using sdsm (Case study: Zarineh roud river basin)</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Scientific and Technology Research</full-title></periodical><pages>1901-1910</pages><volume>9</volume><issue>1</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079446631&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8a2b496bb5488d68518c3ecddeb6f08d</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In the 21st century, climate change is considered as one of the greatest environmental threats in the world, and changes in climate maximization have more negative effects on human society and the natural environment than climate change. Zarineh Roud River Basin in the south of Urmia Lake is of great importance because of its importance in economic and agricultural activities as well as providing a major section of the water input to Lake Urmia. Therefore, in this study the impacts of climate changes on the water resources of the Zarineh Roud River Basin have been studied according to the predicted climate change and its effects on a global scale. In this study, precipitation and temperature were used as key variables for water resources analysis. The Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM) was also used to downscaling global circulation model (GCM). Predictive variables were selected on the basis of partial correlation (r) and p-value, and a 17-year baseline period from 1984-2001was used to assess climate change. The base period was divided into two periods for SDSM calibration and validation: 1984 to 1995 and 1996 to 2001. In this case, ground measurements and atmospheric information revised from the US National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) were used. During the validation, the scenario generator in the SDSM model was used to generate simulation time series for five stations in the region including: Mahabad, Takab, Maragheh, Saqez and Zarineh. For precipitation, the R2 statistic for the SDSM model for the two calibration and validation periods was 0.2-0.07 and 0.21-0.63, respectively. Correlation coefficient r ranged from 0.03-0.05 indicates low performance and 0.46-0.8 indicates high performance of SDSM model. R2 values were calculated as 0.42-0.5 and 0.98-0.6 for temperature, respectively. © 2020 IJSTR.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Attar, N F</author><author>Pham, Q B</author><author>Nowbandegani, S F</author><author>Rezaie-Balf, M</author><author>Fai, C M</author><author>Ahmed, A N</author><author>Pipelzadeh, S</author><author>Dung, T D</author><author>Nhi, P T T</author><author>Khoi, D N</author><author>El-Shafie, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Enhancing the prediction accuracy of data-driven models for monthly streamflow in Urmia Lake Basin based upon the autoregressive conditionally heteroskedastic time-series model</title><secondary-title>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Sciences (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/app10020571</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079830406&amp;doi=10.3390%2Fapp10020571&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7070b43fa7e6371fe6940e49649d6fb2</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Hydrological modeling is one of the important subjects in managing water resources and the processes of predicting stochastic behavior. Developing Data-Driven Models (DDMs) to apply to hydrological modeling is a very complex issue because of the stochastic nature of the observed data, like seasonality, periodicities, anomalies, and lack of data. As streamflow is one of the most important components in the hydrological cycle, modeling and estimating streamflow is a crucial aspect. In this study, two models, namely, Optimally Pruned Extreme Learning Machine (OPELM) and Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detector (CHAID) methods were used to model the deterministic parts of monthly streamflow equations, while Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) was used in modeling the stochastic parts of monthly streamflow equations. The state of art and innovation of this study is the integration of these models in order to create new hybrid models, ARCH-OPELM and ARCH-CHAID, and increasing the accuracy of models. The study draws on the monthly streamflow data of two different river stations, located in north-western Iran, including Dizaj and Tapik, which are on Nazluchai and Baranduzchai, gathered over 31 years from 1986 to 2016. To ascertain the conclusive accuracy, five evaluation metrics including Correlation Coefficient (R), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), the ratio of RMSE to the Standard Deviation (RSD), scatter plots, time-series plots, and Taylor diagrams were used. Standalone CHAID models have better results than OPELM methods considering sole models. In the case of hybrid models, ARCH-CHAID models in the validation stage performed better than ARCH-OPELM for Dizaj station (R = 0.96, RMSE = 1.289 m3/s, NSE = 0.92, MAE = 0.719 m3/s and RSD = 0.301) and for Tapik station (R = 0.94, RMSE = 2.662 m3/s, NSE = 0.86, MAE = 1.467 m3/s and RSD = 0.419). The results remarkably reveal that ARCH-CHAID models in both stations outperformed all other models. Finally, it is worth mentioning that the new hybrid &quot;ARCH-DDM&quot; models outperformed standalone models in predicting monthly streamflow. © 2020 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amirataee, B</author><author>Montaseri, M</author><author>Rezaie, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An advanced data collection procedure in bivariate drought frequency analysis</title><secondary-title>Hydrological Processes</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrological Processes</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/hyp.13866</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088843249&amp;doi=10.1002%2Fhyp.13866&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=172d7e6e815cb26a512f96b7074db00e</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In recent years, the bivariate frequency analysis of drought duration and severity using independent drought events and copula functions has been under extensive application. Meanwhile, emphasis on the procedure of independent drought data collection leads to the omission of the actual potential of short-term extreme droughts within a long-term independent drought. However, a long-term individual continuous drought as an Unconnected Drought Runs can be considered as a combination of short-term Connected Drought Runs. Thus, an advanced and new procedure of data collection in the bivariate drought characteristics analysis has been developed in this study. The results indicated a high relative advantage of the new proposed procedure in analysing bivariate drought characteristics (i.e., drought duration and severity frequency analysis). This advantage has been reflected in the more appropriate determination of the best copula and significant reduction in the uncertainty of bivariate drought frequency analysis. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Alizadeh, A</author><author>Rajabi, A</author><author>Shabanlou, S</author><author>Yaghoubi, B</author><author>Yosefvand, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Simulation of rainfall and runoff time series using robust machine learning</title><secondary-title>Irrigation and Drainage</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Irrigation and Drainage</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ird.2518</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85090058350&amp;doi=10.1002%2Fird.2518&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=08db429bb98d105b53d09463925991c1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>In this paper, the precipitation and runoff time-series data of the Shaharchay River basin from 2000 to 2017 are simulated by a modern hybrid artificial intelligence technique. In order to develop the mentioned artificial intelligence model, the extreme learning machine (ELM), differential evolution and wavelet transform are combined and the SAELM and WASAELM hybrid models are provided. Initially, the most effective lags of the time-series data are distinguished using an autocorrelation function. Using the lags, seven artificial intelligence models are defined for each of the SAELM and WSAELM models. To simulate precipitation and runoff, the sym and coif mother wavelets are chosen as the optimal ones, respectively. For the best model, the values of R2, the scatter index and the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSC) for simulating precipitation yielded 0.967, 0.208 and 0.965, respectively. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis shows that the lags (t-1), (t-2) and (t-12) are regarded as the most effective input lags. Ultimately, an uncertainty analysis is carried out for the superior model that the performance of this model in simulating precipitation and runoff is over- and underestimated, respectively. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2020 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Khalilzadeh, R</author><author>Pirzad, A</author><author>Sepehr, E</author><author>Khan, S</author><author>Anwar, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Long-Term Effect of Heavy Metal–Polluted Wastewater Irrigation on Physiological and Ecological Parameters of Salicornia europaea L.</title><secondary-title>Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s42729-020-00299-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85088641943&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs42729-020-00299-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=819d526030bdfdc6d1b0b6c99f9ca5ee</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Irrigation of Salicornia europaea with heavy metal–polluted wastewater is a promising alternative method for risk mitigation of the Urmia Lake ecosystem from uncontrolled sewage. The objective of the study was to evaluate morphological and physicochemical responses of Salicornia europaea under wastewater irrigation at different growth stages. A field experiment was conducted in a split-plot experiment based on randomized complete block design with four replications. Treatments included control and wastewater irrigation (containing zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), copper (Cu), cadmium (Cd), lead (Pb), and nickel (Ni)) at three stages (vegetative, flowering, and reproductive) of plant growth and two times (two and 4 days in each stage). The result showed that the wastewater application at reproductive stage resulted in higher biomass production than that of the control plants. Wastewater irrigation at the flowering stage caused a significant increase in the amount of total chlorophyll and chlorophyll-a, while chlorophyll-b content was decreased at both flowering and reproductive stages. The amount of the total soluble protein was also affected, with wastewater irrigation showing the most significant increase at the reproductive stage. There was significant enhancement of osmolytes in leaves of plant under heavy metal stress, and the increased rate of proline was higher than soluble sugar at the flowering stage. Relative water content in Salicornia was not duration- and time-dependent. A 154% increase in catalase activity, 32% increase in peroxidase activity, and 57% increase in polyphenol oxidase activity were observed in the plant exposed to long-term wastewater duration. Based on the observed positive effect of wastewater on shoot length and weight, total soluble protein, proline, soluble sugar, enzyme activities, and plant biomass of Salicornia europaea, long-term effect of heavy metal–polluted wastewater irrigation can be approved for Salicornia crops in coastal areas. © 2020, Sociedad Chilena de la Ciencia del Suelo.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feshangsaz, N</author><author>Semsarha, F</author><author>Tackallou, S H</author><author>Nazmi, K</author><author>Monaghan, E P</author><author>Riedo, A</author><author>van Loon, J.J.W.A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Survival of the Halophilic Archaeon Halovarius luteus after Desiccation, Simulated Martian UV Radiation and Vacuum in Comparison to Bacillus atrophaeus</title><secondary-title>Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Origins of Life and Evolution of Biospheres</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11084-020-09597-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85087496024&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11084-020-09597-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=cd9cd402d0fe60c4ae19e546c162cf5a</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Extraterrestrial environments influence the biochemistry of organisms through a variety of factors, including high levels of radiation and vacuum, temperature extremes and a lack of water and nutrients. A wide variety of terrestrial microorganisms, including those counted amongst the most ancient inhabitants of Earth, can cope with high levels of salinity, extreme temperatures, desiccation and high levels of radiation. Key among these are the haloarchaea, considered particularly relevant for astrobiological studies due to their ability to thrive in hypersaline environments. In this study, a novel haloarchaea isolated from Urmia Salt Lake, Iran, Halovarius luteus strain DA50T, was exposed to varying levels of simulated extraterrestrial conditions and compared to that of the bacteria Bacillus atrophaeus. Bacillus atrophaeus was selected for comparison due to its well-described resistance to extreme conditions and its ability to produce strong spore structures. Thin films were produced to investigate viability without the protective influence of cell multi-layers. Late exponential phase cultures of Hvr. luteus and B. atrophaeus were placed in brine and phosphate buffered saline media, respectively. The solutions were allowed to evaporate and cells were encapsulated and exposed to radiation, desiccation and vacuum conditions, and their post-exposure viability was studied by the Most Probable Number method. The protein profile using High Performance Liquid Chromatography and Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization bench top reflector time-of-flight are explored after vacuum and UV-radiation exposure. Results showed that the change in viability of the spore-forming bacteria B. atrophaeus was only minor whereas Hvr. luteus demonstrated a range of viability under different conditions. At the peak radiation flux of 105 J/m2 under nitrogen flow and after two weeks of desiccation, Hvr. luteus demonstrated the greatest decrease in viability. This study further expands our understanding of the boundary conditions of astrobiologically relevant organisms in the harsh space environment. © 2020, The Author(s).</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Biazar, S M</author><author>Fard, A F</author><author>Singh, V P</author><author>Dinpashoh, Y</author><author>Majnooni-Heris, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimation of Evaporation from Saline-Water with More Efficient Input Variables</title><secondary-title>Pure and Applied Geophysics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Pure and Applied Geophysics</full-title></periodical><keywords/><dates><year>2020</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00024-020-02570-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85089882575&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00024-020-02570-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=34c58745cc5930fe786ac0d39cb3a87f</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Selection of optimal model inputs is a challenge for non-linear dynamic models. The questions as to which inputs should be used for model development have been a challenge in practice. Despite its importance, the literature on comparison of different methods for choosing inputs for estimating evaporation from saline water is limited. In this study, used three methods namely the Gamma test (GT), entropy theory (EnT), and procrustes analysis (PA) for determining suitable variables for estimating saline water evaporation using non-linear models of artificial neural network (ANN). The weather station near Lake Urmia was used for this experiment. At this station, pans of different concentrations (500 g/L, 300 g/L, 100 g/L, 50 g/L, 20 g/L, 10 g/L, 5 g/L, and drinking water) were prepared. In addition to evaporation data, surface water temperature (measured for each pan separately), air temperature, mean cloudiness, sunshine hours, mean relative humidity, mean wind speed, solar radiation, maximum wind speed, station pressure, mean station vapor pressure, maximum and minimum temperatures, and precipitation were also used. Model results were compared with field measurements and model performance was evaluated by the coefficient of correlation, root mean square error, and Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient. The most important variables identified by GT were surface water temperature, air temperature, mean relative humidity, mean wind speed, mean station pressure, minimum temperature, precipitation, mean station vapor pressure, and solar radiation. Also, as can be seen the most important variables for evaporation from saline water using the EnT method were water surface temperature, wind speed, and precipitation. The three important variables in the estimation of saline water, evaporation selected by the PA method, were air temperature, sunshine hours, and mean wind speed. According to results, as the concentration increased, the mean station vapor pressure and temperature variables had the most influence on saline water evaporation. The uncertainty of model output was determined using the 95 percent prediction uncertainty (95PPU or P-factor) and d-factor. Although ANN-GT and ANN-EnT showed better goodness-of-fit metrics, ANN-PA had the lowest uncertainty among the three models in estimating evaporation from saline water. Generally, the PA method was able to demonstrate acceptable performance over the other two methods, with the least number of input variables. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Tasumi, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating evapotranspiration using METRIC model and Landsat data for better understandings of regional hydrology in the western Urmia Lake Basin</title><secondary-title>Agricultural Water Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Agricultural Water Management</full-title></periodical><volume>226</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105805</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 5</notes><research-notes>cited By 5</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072768742&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.agwat.2019.105805&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b2721417ba2ea14531110f3fda134617</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study estimates the evapotranspiration (ET) from the western part of Urmia Lake Basin, Iran, to provide quality spatio-temporal evapotranspiration information for use in achieving regional sustainable water management. A “mapping evapotranspiration with internalized calibration” (METRIC) ET estimation model was adopted to estimate monthly ET for the period between 2014–2016 using Landsat 8 satellite imagery. Several refinements are made to adjust the model to the local environment. The refinements include estimating evaporation from the saline lake, correction of the underestimation of city surface temperature through the modification of thermal emissivity, as well as modifications of minor assumptions applied in METRIC. The estimation results for ET obtained using METRIC were compared with independent estimation of ET using the FAO-56 approach in order to assess the estimation accuracy. The comparison showed good correlation between the two types of estimation results for irrigated agriculture, implying successful estimation of ET in this region. ET estimated in non-irrigated bare soil fields was prone to overestimation. The novelty of this study lies in the fact that this is the first ET data for this basin with 100 m spatio-temporal resolution and accuracy information. Therefore, the estimation procedure and results are expected to contribute to a better understanding of the regional hydrology. This is necessary both for the restoration of Urmia Lake and for achieving sustainable water management in the region. © 2019 The Author</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Delfi, S</author><author>Mosaferi, M</author><author>Hassanvand, M S</author><author>Maleki, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Investigation of aerosols pollution across the eastern basin of Urmia lake using satellite remote sensing data and HYSPLIT model</title><secondary-title>Journal of Environmental Health Science and Engineering</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Environmental Health Science and Engineering</full-title></periodical><pages>1107-1120</pages><volume>17</volume><issue>2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40201-019-00425-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85079035416&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs40201-019-00425-3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6460b36a4b3b21fb3f1232ffa598e757</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Background: Desiccation of the world's second hypersaline lake, Lake Urmia, has drawn attention toward the feasibility of particle emissions from the lakebed to downwind regions. Therefore, this research was conducted to study spatiotemporal variations of aerosols across the eastern basin of the lake during 2001 to 2016. Methods: The Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) products of Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), extracted from Terra platform for 999 rural and urban areas and compared over adjacent (Shabestar, Osku, Azarshahr, Ajabshir, Bonab, Malekan), middle (Tabriz and Maragheh) and far (Bostanabad, Heris, and Sarab) counties. Number of dusty days and direction of high wind speeds (≥ 11 m/s) were acquired from the East Azerbaijan Meteorological Organization and analyzed. Moreover, performing the backward trajectory model, the origin and distribution of aerosols were determined at altitudes of 500, 1000 and 2000 m. Results: The spatiotemporal variations of AOD provided statistically significant correlations (R2 ≥ 0.5 and p &amp;lt; 0.05) against the number of dusty days. AOD value was higher between 2009 and 2016 and estimated to be 0.36, 0.33 and 0.31 over adjacent, middle and far areas, respectively. Analysis of wind direction and trajectory plots implied that the particulate matter (PM) of study area was mainly transported from Iraq and Syria, especially in April, May and June months. Conclusions: PM has followed an increasing trend, while the adjacent areas have experienced higher pollution compared to far counties. The southwestern winds can play an important role in transportation of aerosols from either lakebed or western countries to the study area. © 2019 Springer Nature Switzerland AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sarindizaj, E E</author><author>Zarghami, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sustainability assessment of restoration plans under climate change by using system dynamics: Application on Urmia Lake, Iran</title><secondary-title>Journal of Water and Climate Change</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Water and Climate Change</full-title></periodical><pages>938-952</pages><volume>10</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2166/wcc.2018.209</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85078062897&amp;doi=10.2166%2Fwcc.2018.209&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=952c4f33758592109e3ae2a3b54556cd</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>During the last decade, Urmia Lake has lost most of its surface area. As a result, finding management practices to restore the sustainable ecological status of Urmia Lake, the world’s second largest hyper-saline lake, is imperative. In this study, the sustainability of different plans under climate change was assessed using system dynamics. The plans were evaluated with respect to sustainability criteria including reliability, resiliency, and vulnerability measures. According to the results due to different management practices, on average, water consumption should be reduced by at least 30% to restore the lake. The results revealed that only hybrid plans which incorporate multiple management practices, instead of focusing on just one approach, can be influential. Among the hybrid plans, that of increasing irrigation efficiency, reducing cultivated area, changing crop pattern, and inter-basin water transfer was identified as the most sustainable plan. About eight years after applying this plan, the lake will achieve its ecological level and will remain sustainable. Considering comprehensive factors, the proposed model can help watershed managers to take the necessary measures to restore this vital ecosystem. The results of this study can be applied to water resources systems with the same problem, especially those in semi-arid regions with multidisciplinary aspects. © IWA Publishing 2019.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mehr, S S</author><author>Moghaddam, A A</author><author>Field, M S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Hydrogeological and geochemical evidence for the origin of brackish groundwater in the Shabestar plain aquifer, northwest Iran</title><secondary-title>Sustainable Water Resources Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sustainable Water Resources Management</full-title></periodical><pages>1381-1404</pages><volume>5</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s40899-017-0192-6</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85082709310&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs40899-017-0192-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d7a4f0768520ff1ea972e5c893851e2b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Shabestar plain aquifer is located in the northeast of the hypersaline Urmia Lake, northwest Iran. There are two types of the aquifer in the plain: an unconfined aquifer that covers the plain and a confined aquifer that is just in the vicinity of the lake. In recent years, some of the agricultural wells have become salinized by saline water due to unrestricted groundwater pumping. Groundwater in the confined aquifer in comparison with the above unconfined aquifer is of good quality. The salty Urmia Lake is considered the most probable source of groundwater salinization. Other potential sources of groundwater salinization could include halite dissolution, and halite is exposed at the southern end of Shabestar plain, and evaporation from the shallow water table. The water samples, based on their total dissolved solid and chloride contents, are classified in the brackish group. The hydrogeological setting and boreholes log interpretation suggest that the saltwater is the result of Urmia Lake water that is entrapped within the fine-grained matrix from when the lake reached its greatest extent. The ratios of Na/Cl, Br/Cl, (Ca + Mg)/SO4, Mg/Cl, (2Ca + Na)/Cl and Rittenhouse diagram preclude halite dissolution as a salinity source and confirm that the lake water with the composition of seawater is the main cause of groundwater salinization. In addition, Li/Cl ratios indicate that the original briny water was somewhat affected by evaporation. However, the effect of evaporation was found to be, at most, a minor influence only. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>KhazaiPoul, A</author><author>Moridi, A</author><author>Yazdi, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Multi-Objective Optimization for Interactive Reservoir-Irrigation Planning Considering Environmental Issues by Using Parallel Processes Technique</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Management</full-title></periodical><pages>5137-5151</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11269-019-02420-7</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076031659&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11269-019-02420-7&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=36994cfb611b50d2149ad76b90239b4b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Water allocation to different users implies a trade-off between the benefits perceived by different sectors and environmental demands. This conflict, considering the income of different sectors and environmental issues, is very crucial, especially in reservoir operation. In this study, a multi-objective optimization algorithm combined with two simulation models (SWAT and WEAP) has been developed to consider the tradeoff between agricultural benefit and environmental water demand through parallel processing. In this model, decision variables are monthly agricultural demands which are considered as inputs into the Water Evaluation And Planning (WEAP) model. Then, the production of different crops and discharge to the downstream lake are obtained based on the allocated water to each sector using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model. After the simulation, the objective functions are calculated based on agricultural income and environmental flow discharged to the downstream lake. To evaluate the performance of the proposed model, Mahabad reservoir, in Mahabad river basin (located at the south of the Lake Urmia and northwestern of Iran), was studied during a drought period. This reservoir supplies domestic, industry, agriculture water of the Mahabad plain and downstream environmental demand which is discharged to the Lake Urmia. Non-dominated Sorting Differential Evolution (NSDE) algorithm is used to find the optimal water allocation to different sectors and efficient agricultural irrigation patterns of different crops (winter wheat, alfalfa, apple, and sugar beet). Results showed the optimal operation of the reservoir through irrigation management could improve water stress indicator from 80% in traditional irrigation pattern to 60%, only by 6.5% decrease in agricultural income.

Accordingly, physicochemical parameters from 77 groundwater wells were assessed using multivariate statistics and hydrogeochemical analysis in case of groundwater salinity and quality of Azarshahr plain. Based on the electric conductivity of the water, the results show that almost 41% of the wells are freshwater (&amp;lt; 1000 µS/cm), 18% slightly saline water (1000–3000 µS/cm), and 42% moderately saline water (3000–10,000 µS/cm). Based on Gibbs plot, rock weathering was a dominant process in the plain so that about 80.7% of the samples fall under very hard class. Results from Principle Component Analysis and Hierarchical Cluster Analysis divided the groundwater into four distinct zones: cluster 1 in the western area of the plain is known as recharge zone (Ca–HCO3 water type), cluster 2 northwest of the study area is influenced by saline water up-coning during agriculture pumping (Ca–Cl water type), cluster 3 north of the study area is affected by rock weathering (Ca–HCO3–Cl water type), and finally cluster 4 in the central plain is mostly influenced by wastewater and agricultural fertilizers (Ca–SO4–Cl water type). It was also found that there are high concentrations of TDS, Cl−, and SO4 2− in the agricultural areas which was also showing an increasing trend within 2010–2014. Finally, it was found that agricultural activity, contamination and salinization from irrigation, use of fertilities, and up-coning salt water during pumping are among the factors in deterioration of groundwater resources in the studied area. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>RazaviToosi, S L</author><author>Samani, J M V</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Fuzzy Group Decision Making Framework Based on ISM-FANP-FTOPSIS for Evaluating Watershed Management Strategies</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Management</full-title></periodical><pages>5169-5190</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11269-019-02423-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85076193020&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11269-019-02423-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=598eff85f0cc576710c9b29c8bf23d9b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Watershed planning and management is a complex process due to existing different influential criteria in social, economic and environmental sectors as well as complicated interactions among them. Therefore, evaluating watershed management programs needs a comprehensive approach considering network relations among criteria and diverse decision-makers’ judgments. This paper presents a new framework of group decision-making in evaluating and ranking watersheds for implementing development strategies. The model includes 18 criteria in social, economic, managerial and environmental clusters. Five watersheds are considered as alternatives. At first, the network relations among the various criteria are determined using the Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) method. Then, based on the relationships obtained by ISM and decision-makers’ judgments, the alternatives’ priority is determined through the Fuzzy Analytic Network Process (FANP) method. To aggregate the group decision-making results, the extended fuzzy TOPSIS method is proposed and the decision-makers’ weights are calculated using Shannon’s entropy method. Finally, the sensitivity analysis of the decision-makers’ weights and alternatives priorities have been conducted. The Monte Carlo method is applied to generate data for sensitivity analysis. According to the results, Urmia Lake is the most preferred watershed and Atrak watershed is ranked in last. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barzegar, R</author><author>Asghari Moghaddam, A</author><author>Soltani, S</author><author>Fijani, E</author><author>Tziritis, E</author><author>Kazemian, N</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Heavy Metal(loid)s in the Groundwater of Shabestar Area (NW Iran): Source Identification and Health Risk Assessment</title><secondary-title>Exposure and Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Exposure and Health</full-title></periodical><pages>251-265</pages><volume>11</volume><issue>4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12403-017-0267-5</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 19</notes><research-notes>cited By 19</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85037989351&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12403-017-0267-5&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=407769ba93d68c91f0f590596439038e</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The aims of this study are to investigate the potential origin of selected heavy metal(loid)s in the Shabestar plain, NW Iran, by means of multivariate statistical techniques (cluster analysis and factor analysis), as well as to determine the dominant factors that affect groundwater quality and to assess the health risk induced by metal(loid)s using the hazard quotients (HQ). Totally, 29 groundwater samples were collected from wells in August 2016, and the values of 23 parameters, namely pH, electrical conductivity, concentration of major elements (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, HCO3−, SO42−, Cl−), minor elements (NO3−, F−, B, and Br−) and heavy metal(loid)s (Fe, Al, Cr, Mn, As, Zn, Pb, Cu, and Ni) were measured. The results indicate that some samples were found with As, Pb, and Zn concentrations exceeding WHO standards for drinking water. Results of correlation coefficients between the measured variables reflect the occurrence of weathering and dissolution of rocks, especially silicates and evaporites, with ion exchange and geochemical characteristics similar to the release of some heavy metal(loid)s. According to hierarchical cluster analysis, samples of cluster 1 are affected by alkalinity and accompanied by elements compatible with alkaline ambience (CO32− and Ni). Samples of subcluster 2-1 demonstrate the effect of salinity, attributed to evaporates, irrigation return flow, and influx of Urmia Lake’s brine, while, samples of sub-cluster 2-2 are influenced by agricultural activities. Factor analysis results illustrate the effects of five factors on the quality of groundwater. The factor analysis accounts for the 71.9% of total variance of groundwater quality for geogenic impacts, while 10% of the groundwater quality variance is controlled by agricultural activities which produce excessive amounts of NO3− along with Zn which is contained in fertilizers and agrochemicals. The results of the human health risk assessment show that As is the most dominant metalloid in inducing maximum noncarcinogenic risk among all the heavy metal(loid)s. Based on HI, 45 and 14% of the samples for children and adults, respectively, are found to be in high risk category. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hamzehpour, N</author><author>Shafizadeh-Moghadam, H</author><author>Valavi, R</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exploring the driving forces and digital mapping of soil organic carbon using remote sensing and soil texture</title><secondary-title>Catena</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Catena</full-title></periodical><volume>182</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.catena.2019.104141</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068851782&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.catena.2019.104141&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=51d60d074f703b610503b4375255fdc7</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The main objectives of this paper were 1) to estimate soil organic carbon (SOC) using remote sensing covariates, soil properties, and topographic factors, and 2) to evaluate the interaction and the relative influence of the selected factors on the spatial variation of SOC. Thirteen factors were considered for digital mapping of SOC in the west Urmia Lake in Iran. To quantify multicollinearity among the predictor variables, Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated. Among them, nine independent factors were remained including silt, sand, slope, enhanced vegetation index (EVI), brightness, wetness, land cover, and latitude and longitude. A machine learning algorithm called Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) was calibrated for understanding the spatial dynamic and prediction of SOC. Model performance showed that GBM explained 43.5% (R2) of the SOC variation, and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.23%. Results showed that EVI and sand were the most influential factors of the SOC variation while slope and land cover were the least important ones. Furthermore, significant interaction among EVI-wetness-SOC and EVI-sand-SOC was detected. On the other hand, 45.2% of SOC variation was estimated by remote sensing covariates. These results suggested that GBM was a promising approach for an in-depth understanding of the SOC variation over space. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nazeri Tahroudi, M</author><author>Pourreza-Bilondi, M</author><author>Ramezani, Y</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Toward coupling hydrological and meteorological drought characteristics in Lake Urmia Basin, Iran</title><secondary-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>1511-1523</pages><volume>138</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00704-019-02919-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068016694&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00704-019-02919-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=6c75be137864e75aa21ad5264d8a286b</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Investigation of precipitation characteristics on daily, monthly, and annual time scales can contribute to gaining important information related to temporal and spatial distribution of precipitation or even flow rate challenges (e.g., hydrological droughts). The low levels of long-term precipitation and high variability in different time scales are considered the main inherent characteristics of climate in Iran. Due to the direct effects of precipitation on water resources, especially on the river flow rate, it is necessary to assess the efficient indices to visualize the variations in the components of water resources. One of the main indices is the precipitation concentration index (PCI) which is known as a strong indicator of the precipitation distribution generally used on annual and seasonal scales. In this study, drought analysis in the Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) located in northwest of Iran was performed with the daily river flow rate and monthly precipitation values within the period of 1984–2013. The results of changes in precipitation indicated that the irregularity of precipitation distribution had grown in spring months. Also, due to the diminishing precipitation trend on the annual time scale, PCI index also increased. It is concluded that LUB detected a significant descending trend on the annual, spring, and winter time scales in the last 30 years. The PCI values were proved high irregularity in summer with PCI amount of 20.1 and most regularity in winter with PCI amount of 10.4. This paper also aims to assess the effects of PCI on the river flow rate along with the flow shortness volume values using hydrometric and rain gauge stations within LUB. The results obtained from the changes in river flow rate and flow shortness volume revealed that the river flow rate has mostly a falling trend. Finally, it was observed that the time when the river flow rate data changed happened after beginning of changes in the precipitation data. A decrease in inflow from 900 million cubic meters up to 14 billion cubic meters with high flow shortness volume may happen in worst conditions. These results highlighted the importance of applying water resources management in LUB. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jafari, R</author><author>Hassani, A H</author><author>Torabian, A</author><author>Ghorbani, M A</author><author>Mirbagheri, S A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Prediction of groundwater quality parameter in the Tabriz plain, Iran using soft computing methods</title><secondary-title>Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology - AQUA</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Water Supply: Research and Technology - AQUA</full-title></periodical><pages>573-584</pages><volume>68</volume><issue>7</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2166/aqua.2019.062</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85075433990&amp;doi=10.2166%2Faqua.2019.062&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bc3ebacbfee7c8c3ad76d706eb4ffa0a</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Aquifers are one of the largest available freshwater resources. In this paper, total dissolved solids (TDS) of the groundwater aquifer in Tabriz plain is estimated by groundwater physicochemical parameters including Na, HCO3, Ca, Mg, and SO4 in the eastern region of Urmia Lake. For this purpose, four soft computing approaches, namely, multilayer perceptron (MLP), adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS), support vector machine (SVM), and gene expression programming (GEP) were used to predict TDS for a period of 10 years (2002-2012). Data were collected from the East Azerbaijan Regional Water Organization, which totaled 1,742 samples. In the application, of the whole data set, 70% (1,220 samples) was used for training and 30% (522 samples) for testing. In the following, the correlation coefficient (R), root mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) statistics were used for evaluating the accuracy of the models. According to the results, MLP, ANFIS, SVM, and GEP models could be employed successfully in estimating TDS alterations. A comparison was made between these soft computing approaches that corroborated the superiority of the GEP model over MLP, SVM, and ANFIS models with RMSE¼58.93, R ¼0.998, and MAE¼5.21. © IWA Publishing 2019</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Conference Proceedings">3</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Boueshagh, M</author><author>Hasanlou, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Estimating water level in the urmia lake using satellite data: A machine learning approach</title><secondary-title>International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Archives of the Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing and Spatial Information Sciences - ISPRS Archives</full-title></periodical><pages>219-226</pages><volume>42</volume><issue>4/W18</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/isprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-219-2019</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85083239642&amp;doi=10.5194%2Fisprs-archives-XLII-4-W18-219-2019&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d180657c666c392b6a667137dd430007</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Lakes play a pivotal role in the development of cities and have major impacts on the ecosystem balancing of the area. Remote sensing techniques and advanced modeling methods make it possible to monitor natural phenomena, such as lakes' water level. The ecosystem of Urmia Lake is one of the most momentous ecosystems in Iran, which is almost close-ended and has become a global environmental issue in recent years. One of the parameters affecting this lake water level is snowfall, which has a key role in the fluctuations of its water level and water resources management. Hence, the purpose of this paper is the Urmia Lake water level estimation during 2000-2006 using observed water level, snow cover, direct precipitation, and evaporation. For this purpose, Support Vector Regression (SVR), which is the most outstanding kernel method (with various kernel types), has been used. Furthermore, four scenarios are considered with different variables as inputs, and the output of all scenarios is the water level of the lake. The results of training and testing data indicate the substantial impact of snow on retrieving the water level of the Urmia Lake at the desired period, and due to the complexity of the data relationships, the Gaussian kernel generally had better results. On the other hand, Quadratic and Cubic kernels did not work well. The fourth scenario, with RBF kernel has the best results [Training: R2 Combining double low line 97% and RMSE Combining double low line 0.09 m, Testing: R2 Combining double low line 96.97% and RMSE Combining double low line 0.08 m]. © 2019 M.

In general, groundwater is a part of the water cycle in nature that can be collected by wells, qanats, drains, or natural springs. In this research, the potential of groundwater vulnerability in Ajabshir plain, located in the Southwest of East Azerbaijan Province and Southeast of the Urmia Lake, Iran, is investigated using 7 hydrogeological parameters as well as land-use criterion. Depth to water map is provided using 26 boreholes. Twenty-seven drilling points are also used in generating aquifer media and impact of vadose zone maps. After providing and ranking all layers, they are multiplied by appropriate weights and overlaid to produce vulnerability map. Modified-DRASTIC model is applied to achieve the aim. According to the results, an approximately large part of the aquifer (29 percent), mostly located in the west of the plain, is covered with moderate vulnerability class. Spearman correlation coefficient is calculated 0.63 between the vulnerability and land use maps. © 2019 M.

Water resources play a crucial role in the life of human on the planet. Among the water resources, salty lakes are of particular importance in biological, physical and environmental issues. In this study, a new Salty Water Index (SWI) for Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) images is proposed based on salty lakes by particle swarm optimization (PSO), where water doesn't combine by cloud, shadow, and salty areas. SWI is implemented on four famous and important salty lakes with the proper distribution of the whole world and different Salinity, including Lake Assal, Great Salt Lake, Eyre Lake, and Lake Urmia. The performance of SWI is compared with other water indices by overall accuracy, f-score, kappa coefficient, and standard deviation to mean ratio. Results show the efficiency of SWI on all cases due to 0.0055 Standard deviation to mean for SWI compared to 0.0395, 0.0255, 0.0873, 0.0214, 0.0524, 0.0408 and 0.0375 for NDWI, MNDWI, AWEIsh, AWEI, WRI, MOWI, and MBWI, respectively. Also, Effectiveness criteria (E) determines the efficiency of each band of Landsat 8. In this regard, results show the high performance of Green and Near IR band in all conditions and relatively proper performance of some other bands based on a special condition of each case study. The proposed method is also suggested to readers to obtain novel spectral indices of other classes and other sensors. © 2019 F.

In addition, mapping and change detection of water bodies as an essential natural resource is imperative for robust operations and sustainable management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) sensors with long wavelengths have a high potential for delineating the extent of the flooded areas and providing timely and accurate maps of surface water for risk mitigation and disaster or sustainable management. In this study, multi-temporal Sentinel-1 C-band SAR images were utilized to investigate the performance of the sensor backscatter image on permanent water bodies monitoring and flooded areas mapping. Lake Urmia as a permanent water system and two floods in Golestan and Khuzestan provinces of Iran have been investigated. The backscatter values of an image acquired before the event that is referred as an Archive image and another one after the event as a Crisis image are analysed. As a preliminary result, it is concluded that with overlaying of the two bands from Archive and Crisis images and creating a color composite image, the permanent water bodies have a uniformly dark return due to the very low backscatter in both images. The flooded areas and changes in water level show relatively higher backscatter in the Crisis image, whereas the other land cover features indicate very high backscatter values with tones of grey.

The lake has been facing a serious environmental crisis, due to water mismanagement in the basin. To address this problem, an analysis of the hydrodynamic behavior and of salinity distribution is important. The three-dimensional numerical model MIKE 3 Flow Model FM was employed in this study. Model sensitivity analyses revealed that wind speed, friction coefficient, and vertical eddy viscosity are effective parameters on both flow velocities and salinity distribution, while bottom roughness height has minor effects on surface velocities. Reduced value for vertical eddy viscosity improves the simulation of the velocity field and has an adverse effect on salinity distribution. The UNESCO density function leads to an overestimation of density. Yet, final model results are accurate enough to reproduce the salinity distribution over the lake, revealing that the salinity difference between North and South basins of Lake Urmia increases significantly in the wet season, due to southern rivers inflows by snowmelt. For the simulated periods of 1986–1987 and 2004–2005, natural and man-induced drought hydrological conditions, the direction of flows was from south to north, with a much lower net flow in the latter period. This decrease in the exchanged flows causes higher salinity difference among basins. Results indicate that the present model could be run for any time period in both normal and drought conditions and can satisfactorily simulate the hydrodynamic characteristics and salinity distribution of Lake Urmia for management purposes. © 2019, © 2019 Japan Society of Civil Engineers.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gachlou, M</author><author>Roozbahani, A</author><author>Banihabib, M E</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comprehensive risk assessment of river basins using Fault Tree Analysis</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><volume>577</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.123974</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069694856&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhydrol.2019.123974&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=855449516f2ef5e419974bdb3e5d09a9</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Due to the increasing need of human societies and diverse biological species for adequate and reliable water resources, river basins play an important role in reliable water supply. A comprehensive index for assessing the performance of river basins can prevent unintentional events by accurately identifying vulnerabilities and threats. In the present study, comprehensive risk assessment of a river basin is carried out using Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to determine the undesirable events. The FTA method, based on a logical diagram, reveals the relationships of basic events and the top event by logical gates and is capable of providing quantitative and qualitative analysis of the river basin. It can show the failure paths and calculates the degree of basins’ reliability. In this study, undesirable ecological status, low quality and scarcity of water resources, and economic and social anomalies were studied as unfavorable events of the Urmia Lake Basin. To do this, an FTA model is presented in which “Water Resources Failure Risk of Urmia Lake Basin” is the top event. The probability of occurrence of basic events and top event was calculated based on the information available for the area and using experts’ opinions. The results of the study show that quality failure have the most impact on top event occurrence. The effective basic events in the occurrence of the top event are “Inappropriate governance”, “low awareness level”, “Entrance of industrial and domestic wastewater to groundwater”, “Entrance of agricultural wastewater to groundwater”, and “Meteorological drought”, respectively. The index derived from the FTA can provide water resources managers and decision makers with comprehensive measure to improve and compare the status of internal and external effective factors in river basins. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fathian, F</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dynamic memory of Urmia Lake water-level fluctuations in hydroclimatic variables</title><secondary-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>591-603</pages><volume>138</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00704-019-02844-6</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064485868&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00704-019-02844-6&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=53bc16561f6c8fb2c64499a2df74401f</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Dynamic changes in hydroclimatic variables (HC) and their effects on fluctuations of water-level (WL) are an important issue in order to properly manage available water resources. The present study presents an original view of the modeling of monthly WL fluctuations of Urmia Lake (UL), northwestern Iran, during 1986–2016. In order to study the nonlinear association between WL and HC, the hybrid of linear Autoregressive Moving Average with eXogenous variable (ARMAX) and nonlinear Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) as well as the multivariate GARCH (MGARCH) time series models are used. The fitted models identified streamflow, temperature, precipitation, wind speed, relative humidity, and day length as the affecting factors on the WL’s time-varying mean and variance. There are significant relationships between the dynamic behavior of conditional covariances of HC and WL, showing that WL depends relatively strong on weather conditions. The highest depth of memory in this dynamic process is related to streamflow. The results show that this association between HC and WL is more powerful when UL’s WL has been more than 1274 m and does not seem to change linearly through time. The results of this study are useful to understand UL’s WL dynamic behavior under the influence of weather conditions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abbasi, A</author><author>Khalili, K</author><author>Behmanesh, J</author><author>Shirzad, A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Drought monitoring and prediction using SPEI index and gene expression programming model in the west of Urmia Lake</title><secondary-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>553-567</pages><volume>138</volume><issue>1-2</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00704-019-02825-9</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 6</notes><research-notes>cited By 6</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064435009&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00704-019-02825-9&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=2ab04dbfee006e522191b64f0695b27e</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Iran is a part of the arid and semi-arid regions of the world and many of its areas suffer from repeated droughts. Due to the fact that recent droughts have put a lot of pressure on water supply systems, drought management have a particular importance. For this purpose, monitoring and forecasting systems can be considered as appropriate tools. In this research, monitoring and prediction of drought in the Urmia synoptic station in short-, medium-, and long-term timescales were investigated using the SPEI (standardized precipitation and evapotranspiration drought index) and gene expression programming model. For this purpose, the SPEI was calculated for timescales 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 48 months with using monthly rainfall and temperature data from 1951 to 2009, and its performance was compared with standard precipitation index (SPI). The results showed that the correlation coefficient of SPEI and SPI in the 3-, 12-, and 48-month timescales were 0.84, 0.845, and 0.776, respectively. The monitoring results showed two long periods of drought-related years 1959–1967 and 1998–2009 during the statistical period. After drought monitoring based on SPEI time series, drought was predicted using gene expression programming models with delays of 1 to 5 months. According to the results, the prediction accuracy was increased by increasing the scale of SPEI so that the correlation coefficient in the test stage in the one-month scale (SPEI1) increased from 0.215 to 0.984 in 48-month scale (SPEI48) and the overall accuracy of the model increased from 60.1 in SPEI1 to 92.3% in SPEI48. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mahdavi, T</author><author>Bagheri, A</author><author>Hosseini, S A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applying the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts for Water (SEEA-Water) for integrated assessment of water security in an aquifer scale - Case study: Azarshahr aquifer, Iran</title><secondary-title>Groundwater for Sustainable Development</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Groundwater for Sustainable Development</full-title></periodical><volume>9</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.gsd.2019.100261</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071521482&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.gsd.2019.100261&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=93b99142d34e25603da6048ab86f2398</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As an important stage in integrated water resources management, integrated assessment adopts a set of indicators to address not only the physical water balance, but also the role of water in social welfare, economic production, and employment. The indicators should be located in an analytical framework capable of figuring out the inter-relationships among different environmental, social, and economic disciplines. Adopting the System of Environmental and Economic Accounts for Water (developed by the United Nations), this paper aims to provide an integrated assessment in the groundwater resource in the Azarshahr aquifer area in the Northwestern Iran, comparing local water security indicators in 2006 and 2016. The results show that the local water resource in the study area is highly stressed in terms of quantity and quality. In addition, the area suffers severely from unsustainability and dis-equilibrium between water resource and consumption. Using a system dynamics model developed in VENSIM PLE, the paper analyzed five different policy options, which could have been devised to improve the water security in the area. The policy option 1 (stepwise reduction in the irrigated agricultural area from 2006 to 2010 followed by a constant 2% decline from 2010 to 2016) was found more effective in controlling the water salinity. Since it is highly inelastic in terms of regional economic revenue, it could be a cost-effective policy to prevent salinization of water with low impacts on the regional revenue. The methodology can be applied for building water accounting systems in similar areas for the purpose of integrated water resources assessment and planning. © 2019</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Jalilvand, E</author><author>Tajrishy, M</author><author>Ghazi Zadeh Hashemi, S A</author><author>Brocca, L</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of irrigation water using remote sensing of soil moisture in a semi-arid region</title><secondary-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Remote Sensing of Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>231</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.rse.2019.111226</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 16</notes><research-notes>cited By 16</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067084654&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.rse.2019.111226&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=84fa1eaa54522bd5dd21d7ab28282b8e</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Irrigated agriculture is the principal consumer of fresh water resources. Most countries do not have a precise measurement of water consumption for irrigation. In this study, an innovative approach is proposed that allows for estimation of irrigation water use at the catchment scale based on satellite soil moisture data. To this end, the SM2RAIN algorithm, which had been originally developed for estimation of rainfall from the soil moisture observations, is adopted. The satellite soil moisture observations obtained from Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) along with different rainfall and evapotranspiration (ET) products in the period 2012–2015 are used as the input to the model. The methodology is tested in the agricultural plains of southern Urmia Lake, which is one of the main agricultural plains in Iran for which actual irrigation data is available. The results reveal that the proposed approach can capture the overall irrigation pattern, although; it is systematically overestimating irrigation volume compared to observed irrigation data. Thus the bias is calculated over largely non-irrigated pixels and used to modify the model estimates. The bias-corrected results show good agreement with the in situ irrigation data. In particular, the average model performance in the irrigated pixels in terms of R and RMSE (mm/month) are (0.86 and 12.895) respectively. Accuracy varied depending on the inputs, with improvement in order of 11% and 42% in R and RMSE depending on the inputs chosen. The method is also applied to less irrigated areas that result in obtaining significantly lower irrigation rates. The low spatial resolution of soil moisture products (i.e. ~50 km) makes it difficult to capture the irrigation water of small irrigated croplands. Unreliable rainfall and ET data can also lead to the over/underestimation of irrigation. In spite of the above limitations (particularly lack of reliable ET dataset), the proposed model can still capture the irrigation pattern, given that strong soil moisture signal from irrigation is detected by the satellite. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vaheddoost, B</author><author>Aksoy, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reconstruction of Hydrometeorological Data in Lake Urmia Basin by Frequency Domain Analysis Using Additive Decomposition</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Management</full-title></periodical><pages>3899-3911</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11269-019-02335-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071294010&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11269-019-02335-3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a20f50b374f826d752f3728a5d2ffd7f</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Frequency domain analysis using an additive decomposition method is proposed to reconstruct the missing hydrometeorological data of selected sites in Lake Urmia basin in Iran. Precipitation, evaporation, streamflow and groundwater time series are used for this aim. Trends, within- and multi-year cycles, and randomness are taken into account to reconstruct each of the time series for which models are developed, calibrated and validated separately. Statistical similarity between the observed and reconstructed time series is checked. Statistical characteristics including the average, standard deviation, skewness, and the first-order autocorrelation coefficient are well preserved at the reconstructed time series.

This condition has threatened biota life, intensified desertification around the lake, and raised social concerns by adversely impacting the inhabitants’ health and economy. In 2013, the Urmia Lake Restoration National Committee (ULRNC) started implementing certain management practices to stop the drying trend of LU, resulted in the cease of water level drop and stabilization of LU condition in 2016. Nevertheless, the restoration actions have not yet raised the lake to the water level as planned by the roadmap. This paper aims to describe and to assess the LU restoration plans by underscoring the ULRNC achievements, challenges, and shortcomings. In particular, we discuss how the value of data and data-aided modeling has been underestimated by the LU restoration programs, leading to still existing puzzles about the lake interaction with the involving physical processes governing its dynamics. We show how the LU restoration timetable has not fulfilled the planned milestones as evidenced by the inability to capture the anticipated lake water levels, which is partly attributed to the lack of field data and dynamic modeling that could predict the lake response in a more reliable and conservative manner. The current restoration plans should also be revisited to ensure that any practice with the aim of reducing water consumption in the basin is not only environmentally sustainable but also feasible from the socioeconomic perspective. The insights provided by this paper attempt to underscore the value of field data collection for establishing a reliable conceptual model, and for executing pre- and post-monitoring of the lake so that the success or failure of the restoration actions taken by the policymakers can be appropriately evaluated. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pouladi, P</author><author>Afshar, A</author><author>Afshar, M H</author><author>Molajou, A</author><author>Farahmand, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Agent-based socio-hydrological modeling for restoration of Urmia Lake: Application of theory of planned behavior</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>736-748</pages><volume>576</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2019.06.080</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 5</notes><research-notes>cited By 5</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85068512640&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.jhydrol.2019.06.080&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=eb1d9bae2a49c706646f0e558a374eb8</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study proposes a novel socio-hydrological modeling framework for assessing the performance of complex water resources systems. It employs and integrates agent-based modeling (ABM) and the theory of planned behavior (TPB) into the socio-hydrological modeling framework to account for agents’ behaviors. Due to farmers’ major role in anthropogenic droughts, this paper mainly focuses on farmers’ behavior. The TPB framework and the agents’ behavioral rules in ABM are structured based on the data obtained from field questionnaires and interviews by the farmers in the Zarrineh River Basin as the main river feeding the Urmia Lake. The proposed modeling framework, including the TPB and ABM structures and rules, are validated by comparing the results of the proposed socio-hydrological simulation model with the actual data on the simulation period. To assess the ability of the proposed framework, root mean square error (RMSE) and the determination coefficient (DC) were computed. The results show the acceptable performance of the proposed model by RMSE = 0.18 and DC = 0.92. Analysis of the results indicates that financial conditions, farmland size, farmers’ age, and farmers’ education are among the major factors in farmers’ decision-making process, respectively. © 2019</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gavahi, K</author><author>Jamshid Mousavi, S</author><author>Ponnambalam, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Adaptive forecast-based real-time optimal reservoir operations: Application to Lake Urmia</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydroinformatics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydroinformatics</full-title></periodical><pages>908-924</pages><volume>21</volume><issue>5</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.2166/hydro.2019.005</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 3</notes><research-notes>cited By 3</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85073051376&amp;doi=10.2166%2Fhydro.2019.005&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=bf5a2fb1fd2edd3dbb49f4cd06b94907</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Boukan Dam reservoir is the largest infrastructure constructed on the Zarineh-Roud River regulating streamflow for different uses including supplying water to Lake Urmia, the second largest salt lake in the world. This paper presents a forecast-based adaptive real-time optimal operation model (ARTOM) for Boukan reservoir with the aim of maximizing releases feeding the lake while meeting other needs such as irrigation, industrial, and domestic uses. Adaptive neuro-fuzzy system-based inflow-to-reservoir forecasts are used in the ARTOM to determine optimal releases from the reservoir for future months up to the end of a year, but only the current period’s release is applied. At the beginning of the next period, the forecasts are updated, and the procedure is repeated until the last period of the year. Additionally, the optimal terminal end-of-year reservoir storage volume is a dynamic updating input to the ARTOM, which is estimated from the results of a long-term reservoir operation optimization model. The ARTOM performance is tested against the last nine-year monthly data not utilized for training the forecast module. Results demonstrate that the ARTOM attains an objective function value very close to the best possible value that can ever be reached by utilizing an ideal operation model, benefiting from perfect foresight on future streamflows. © IWA Publishing 2019</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Fathian, F</author><author>Dehghan, Z</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using hybrid weighting-clustering approach for regional frequency analysis of maximum 24-hr rainfall based on climatic, geographical, and statistical attributes</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>4413-4428</pages><volume>39</volume><issue>11</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/joc.6082</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85064477652&amp;doi=10.1002%2Fjoc.6082&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=79b3f74847c083fd03805baf7721cf06</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Estimation of extreme rainfall amounts has great importance, especially in some fields such as the design of water structures, water resources engineering, extreme flood management, and soil erosion conservation. One of the problems, which hydrologists faced, is an acceptable estimation of extreme events in areas with insufficient data. In this case, separation of the study area into homogenous regions and performing regional frequency analysis (RFA) result in greater precision and fewer errors in frequency analysis models, enabling estimation of quantiles for each return period in the region of interest. In this study, the maximum 24-hr rainfall data related to Lake Urmia Basin (LUB) for 63 selected stations during the period of 1979–2008 are used. Moreover, determining an appropriate weight for each group of attributes is attempted according to the degree of importance and contribution share of each climatic, geographical, and statistical attribute. Then, for regionalization using a clustering approach, the attributes are defined in seven different groups. Subsequently, the performance of different groups associated with weighted attributes of maximum 24-hr rainfall is evaluated for RFA in the study area. The results showed that the combination of climatic, geographical, and statistical attributes present better results and more reliable estimates of extreme values. The results indicated better performance of weighted models to the attributes compared to non-weighted frequency analysis models in the estimation of maximum 24-hr rainfall. The results also showed that by evaluating three to four groups and applying average weights of 0.3–0.85 for the attributes through the use of hybrid weighting-clustering approach, more accurate estimates of extreme values for different return periods can be obtained. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Azizi, F</author><author>Vadiati, M</author><author>Asghari Moghaddam, A</author><author>Nazemi, A</author><author>Adamowski, J</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A hydrogeological-based multi-criteria method for assessing the vulnerability of coastal aquifers to saltwater intrusion</title><secondary-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>78</volume><issue>17</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12665-019-8556-x</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85071509882&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12665-019-8556-x&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=7539b5a941c6dd5b0bd805c5aa70b505</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The interaction between salt and fresh water is an important issue in coastal aquifer management and there are numerous methods used to assess the vulnerability of coastal aquifer systems to saltwater intrusion. The aim of the present study was to present a hydrogeological-based method that could be applied to all coastal aquifer systems to assess their vulnerability to saltwater intrusion. To achieve this goal, five criteria, namely GWQISI (I), which shows the magnitude of saltwater Intrusion, groundwater level (L), existing Distance between the aquifer and the shore (D), recharge (R) and the saturated thickness of the aquifer (T) were used to develop a novel multi-criteria decision index, ILDRT. The digital integration of the various weights and rates assigned to the five criteria were carried out based on literature, expert knowledge, and the overlay indexing methods and standards. The proposed approach was evaluated to assess the vulnerability of Iran’s Malekan coastal aquifer to saltwater intrusion from Lake Urmia. Results showed that the vulnerability index was most significantly influenced by R based on sensitivity analysis using the map removal method accompanied by single parameter method. Based on the ILDRT results, about 22, 49 and 29% of the total area of the Malekan aquifer was in zones of very low, low and moderate vulnerability to saltwater intrusion, respectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Samadianfard, S</author><author>Jarhan, S</author><author>Salwana, E</author><author>Mosavi, A</author><author>Shamshirband, S</author><author>Akib, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Support vector regression integrated with fruit fly optimization algorithm for river flow forecasting in lake urmia basin</title><secondary-title>Water (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>9</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/w11091934</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 9</notes><research-notes>cited By 9</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85072559131&amp;doi=10.3390%2Fw11091934&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=df98a2362d63e41141c2516eb665c521</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Advancement in river flow prediction systems can greatly empower the operational river management to make better decisions, practices, and policies. Machine learning methods recently have shown promising results in building accurate models for river flow prediction. This paper aims to identify models with higher accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability by inspecting the accuracy of a number of machine learning models. The proposed models for river flow include support vector regression (SVR), a hybrid of SVR with a fruit fly optimization algorithm (FOA) (so-called FOASVR), and an M5 model tree (M5). Additionally, the influence of periodicity (π) on the forecasting enactment was examined. To assess the performance of the proposed models, different statistical meters were implemented, including root mean squared error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), correlation coefficient (R), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Results showed that the FOASVR with RMSE (4.36 and 6.33 m3/s), MAE (2.40 and 3.71 m3/s) and R (0.82 and 0.81) values had the best performance in forecasting river flows at Babarud and Vaniar stations, respectively. Also, regarding BIC parameters, Qt-1 and π were selected as parsimonious inputs for predicting river flow one month ahead. Overall findings indicated that, although both the FOASVR and M5 predicted the river flows in suitable accordance with observed river flows, the performance of the FOASVR was moderately better than the M5 and periodicity noticeably increased the performance of the models; consequently, FOASVR can be suggested as the most accurate method for forecasting river flows. © 2019 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ghiyasi, M</author><author>Siavash Moghaddam, S</author><author>Amirnia, R</author><author>Damalas, C A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chemical Priming with Salt and Urea Improves Germination and Seedling Growth of Black Cumin (Nigella sativa L.) under Osmotic Stress</title><secondary-title>Journal of Plant Growth Regulation</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Plant Growth Regulation</full-title></periodical><pages>1170-1178</pages><volume>38</volume><issue>3</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00344-019-09922-z</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85061271304&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00344-019-09922-z&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=b32f118d84422fcd1735817a389c8f36</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>A common problem with vegetable production in saline areas is poor crop stand, but for black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) germination data are limited and inconsistent. The effects of chemical priming with Urmia lake salt and urea solutions for 16 h at 30 °C on seed germination and seedling growth of black cumin (Nigella sativa L.) were studied under various osmotic stress levels. For a more detailed assessment of chemical priming, the effects of hydropriming for 16 h at 30 °C were also studied. A seed lot that was not exposed to any treatment, except disinfection, was used as control. Osmotic stress levels were − 2, − 4, − 6, and − 8 bar, which were achieved with polyethylene glycol 6000 (PEG 6000). Seed germination of black cumin was reduced by 16.2%, 33.8%, 50.9%, and 74.9% under osmotic potential − 2, − 4, − 6, and − 8 bar, respectively, compared with non-stressed control. Improved germination index values, reduced mean germination time, and increased coefficients of velocity of germination were observed under osmotic stress in primed seeds compared with non-primed control. Averaged over priming treatments, priming improved the final germination percentage by 10.5%, 24.3%, 45.5%, and 74.6% under osmotic potential − 2, − 4, − 6, and − 8 bar, respectively. Post-germination growth was also inhibited under low osmotic potential compared with the non-stressed control. Nevertheless, priming improved length and weight of black cumin seedlings and enhanced peroxidase and catalase activity at all osmotic potential levels compared with non-primed seeds. Higher seedling vigor indices were recorded in seedlings from primed seeds with decreasing osmotic potential levels than non-primed seeds. Urmia lake salt priming had the greatest impact on improving seed germination and vigor indices, especially under osmotic stress conditions. Although seed priming did not completely eliminate the symptoms of osmotic stress in black cumin germination, it is an efficient method to mitigate the impact of osmotic stress on germination of this species. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dehghanipour, A H</author><author>Zahabiyoun, B</author><author>Schoups, G</author><author>Babazadeh, H</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A WEAP-MODFLOW surface water-groundwater model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain, Urmia lake basin, Iran: Multi-objective calibration and quantification of historical drought impacts</title><secondary-title>Agricultural Water Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Agricultural Water Management</full-title></periodical><volume>223</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105704</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069925418&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.agwat.2019.105704&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=da8053b8e5d3f50cc1f2613848cabe84</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>This study develops and applies the first coupled surface water-groundwater (SW-GW) flow model for the irrigated Miyandoab plain located in the Urmia basin, in the northwest of Iran. The model is implemented using a dynamic coupling between MODFLOW and WEAP and consists of spatially distributed monthly water balances for the aquifer, root-zone, rivers, canals, and reservoirs. Multi-objective calibration of the model using river discharge and GW level data yields accurate simulation of historical conditions, and results in better constrained parameters compared to using either data source alone. Model simulations show that crop water demand cannot be met during droughts due to limited GW pumping capacity, and that increased GW pumping has a relatively strong impact on GW levels due to the small specific yield of the aquifer. The SW-GW model provides a unique tool for exploring management options that sustain agricultural production and downstream flow to the shrinking Urmia Lake. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rouzegari, N</author><author>Hassanzadeh, Y</author><author>Sattari, M T</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using the Hybrid Simulated Annealing-M5 Tree Algorithms to Extract the If-Then Operation Rules in a Single Reservoir</title><secondary-title>Water Resources Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water Resources Management</full-title></periodical><pages>3655-3672</pages><volume>33</volume><issue>10</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11269-019-02326-4</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070787271&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs11269-019-02326-4&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=ce0ee3b9e33fe82f3daeb9071e8a448f</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>The environmental water demand of the Mahabad River in the Urmia Lake basin in Iran was first estimated, using the flow duration curve shifting method (FDC Shifting) in this study. Secondly, the optimal operating model of the reservoir was developed with the goals of decreasing the deficiencies and considering the downstream demands of the reservoir, especially the environmental water demands by employing the simulated annealing (SA) and non-linear programming (NLP) methods. The results of the SA algorithm were compared with those of the NLP model with the indices of reliability, resiliency velocity, vulnerability, and sustainability. Then, the optimum released water values in the current month, the optimum water storage values in the reservoir, reservoir inflows and monthly demands were considered as inputs of the M5 tree model, and the optimum values of released water in the next month were considered as outputs of the M5 model. Finally, the optimum operation rules from the reservoir were developed in the form of if-then linear rules for future uses. One of the main advantages of the M5 tree model is to present two operation rules as if-then rules for all the operating periods with relatively acceptable accuracy. The results showed that the SA-M5 tree model, as a method of data mining, can extract the operation rules with relatively high accuracy. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dehghani, M H</author><author>Baghal Asghari, F</author><author>Mahvi, A H</author><author>Yousefi, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Spatiotemporal variation of drying and salinity water basin on the quality of coastal aquifers using geographic information system</title><secondary-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><volume>78</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12665-019-8462-2</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 0</notes><research-notes>cited By 0</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069508674&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12665-019-8462-2&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d783a5651281f88c8be6ec1c9a4348a0</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>One of the most valuable ecosystems that are located in the northwest of Iran is the Urmia Lake Basin. Drying the Urmia Lake has led to an environmental, social and economic crisis. In the present study, in addition, completing information on groundwater quality in the Eastern area of Urmia Lake, the effects of changes in the level and quality of Urmia Lake on basin waters for various utilizations is investigated. To do this research geographic information systems in the study area (including Shabstar, Oskou, Azarshahr, and Ajabsheir plains) was used. Qualitative parameters of groundwater were analyzed using the modified Mann–Kendall test and also with using the Theil–Sen estimator, values of trend slope from 2010 to 2015 were estimated and for doing all of these tests, the software R was used. Accordingly the trend slopes of the qualitative parameters, 40% in Shabstar, 74% in Ajabsheir plain, 26% in the Azarshahr plain, majority of parameters except pH (about 94%) in the Oskou plain have been positive changes trending in SAR, Na+, %Na+, and Cl− indicate which geological and hydrological properties can play a main role in these changes and it can be concluded that changes in the quantity and quality in Lake Urmia has a significant impact on the quality of groundwater in the eastern basin of the Urmia Lake. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sobhani, B</author><author>Zengir, V S</author><author>Kianian, M K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Drought monitoring in the Lake Urmia basin in Iran</title><secondary-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Arabian Journal of Geosciences</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><issue>15</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12517-019-4571-1</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 16</notes><research-notes>cited By 16</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85069442012&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs12517-019-4571-1&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=eacf3cd33f60f46089c31b12cd528e23</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Drought is a reptile phenomenon that is caused by rising temperatures and decreasing rainfall than normal. This phenomenon has a significant impact on the human lives and other organisms. We tried to study the drought status by using the MATLAB software and integrated SEPI in two 3- and 9-month scale in the lake of Urmia. For this purpose, we used the climate data of 5 synoptic stations of Lake Urmia (Tabriz, Maragheh, Urmia, Saghez, Mahabad). The findings of the study indicate that the Standardized Evapotranspiration and Precipitation Index (SEPI) reflects the characteristics of both the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (SEI) indicators, and also introduces the temperature as one of the effective parameters in the change of drought severity in drought conditions; therefore, the study of drought using SEPI is better than that using SPI. Drought investigation indicates that the drought trend is increasing based on SEPI in the Lake Urmia. Temperature is also increasing more intensively. The longest period of drought persistence occurred at the Urmia station on a 3-month scale from June to December 1995 to December 2016 for 24 months in the Lake Urmia basin. The highest drought incidence rate was observed at the Saghez station at the 3-month scale and the lowest in Maragheh. © 2019, Saudi Society for Geosciences.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Vaheddoost, B</author><author>Kocak, K</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temporal dynamics of monthly evaporation in Lake Urmia</title><secondary-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Theoretical and Applied Climatology</full-title></periodical><pages>2451-2462</pages><volume>137</volume><issue>3-4</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00704-018-2747-3</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 1</notes><research-notes>cited By 1</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85059686031&amp;doi=10.1007%2Fs00704-018-2747-3&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=146397e9fd43d977daffd741d6d8c7d7</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>As a UNESCO biosphere, Lake Urmia is a shallow hypersaline lake which is facing a rapid water surface degradation. Evaporation from the surface of the Lake, as a physical process which accelerates the Lake’s degradation, was evaluated using chaos theory. Seven hydrometeorological stations scattered around the Lake were selected, and a 40-year time span between October 1974 and September 2014 was used at each station. Missing data in time series was removed and the whole time series was tested for consistency, randomness, and presence of trend. Since evaporation at each station was measured by means of class A evaporation pan, time series at each station was multiplied by a pan coefficient to incorporate the effect of saline water and free water surface environment simultaneously. Measurement errors arising from assumption of zero evaporation in winter were removed from the time series using locally weighted scatterplot smoothing method after which unification of time series into a single time series is achieved. Results of the data transformation and information loss were monitored by means of auto-correlation, partial-auto-correlation, mutual information, power spectrum, false nearest neighbor, and correlation dimension. A local prediction method is then used to capture the temporal dynamics of the evaporation with consideration of an appropriate time delay and embedding dimension. Finally, the representative model was projected on a 3-dimensional phase space to evaluate the temporal dynamics of the evaporation. Results indicate that the chaotic approach shows accurate predictions in advance. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Javadian, M</author><author>Behrangi, A</author><author>Gholizadeh, M</author><author>Tajrishy, M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>METRIC and WaPOR estimates of evapotranspiration over the Lake Urmia basin: Comparative analysis and composite assessment</title><secondary-title>Water (Switzerland)</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Water (Switzerland)</full-title></periodical><volume>11</volume><issue>8</issue><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/w11081647</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 4</notes><research-notes>cited By 4</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85070560516&amp;doi=10.3390%2Fw11081647&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=226df52700d700e9fc4b17e9a91acdd8</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Evapotranspiration is one of the main components of water and energy balance. In this study, we compare two ET products, suitable for regional analysis at high spatial resolution: The recent WaPOR product developed by FAO and METRIC algorithm. WaPOR is based on ETLook, which is a two-source model and relies on microwave images. WaPOR is unique as it has no limitation under cloudy days, but METRIC is limited by clouds. METRIC and WaPOR are more sensitive to land surface temperature and soil moisture, respectively. Using two years (2010 and 2014) of data over Lake Urmia basin, we show that in most areas, ET from METRIC is higher than WaPOR and the difference has an ascending trend with the elevation. The ET of lysimeter station is fairly consistent with METRIC based on a single observation. Our analysis using NDVI and land use maps suggests that the histogram of ET from WaPOR might be more realistic than METRIC, but not its amount. The fraction of ET to precipitation in rainfed agriculture areas shows thatWaPOR is more accurate than METRIC, mainly because in the absence of other water resources such as ground water annual ET cannot exceed annual precipitation. In contrast, METRIC produces a more realistic estimate than WaPOR over irrigated farms. The results suggest that the two products can complement each other. © 2019 by the authors.</abstract></record><record><database name="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl" path="UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl">UrmiaLibrary-Sep2020.enl</database><ref-type name="Journal Article">0</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matinzadeh, Z</author><author>Akhani, H</author><author>Abedi, M</author><author>Palacio, S</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The elemental composition of halophytes correlates with key morphological adaptations and taxonomic groups</title><secondary-title>Plant Physiology and Biochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Plant Physiology and Biochemistry</full-title></periodical><pages>259-278</pages><volume>141</volume><keywords/><dates><year>2019</year></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.05.023</electronic-resource-num><notes>cited By 2</notes><research-notes>cited By 2</research-notes><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85067045366&amp;doi=10.1016%2Fj.plaphy.2019.05.023&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=a4f6a02c3128ec56893c14c3aa90f7f1</url></web-urls></urls><abstract>Halophytes are crucial in the light of increasing soil salinization, yet our understanding of their chemical composition and its relationship to key morphological traits such as succulence or salt excretion is limited. This study targets this issue by exploring the relationship between the elemental composition of 108 plant species from saline environments in Iran and their eco-morphological traits and taxonomy. Leaves and/or photosynthetic shoots of individual species and soils were sampled and analyzed for 20 elements in plant samples and 5 major elements plus % gypsum content, pH, and EC in soil samples. Eu-halophytes and leaf- and stem-succulent and salt-recreting plants showed high concentrations of Na, S, and Mg and low concentrations of Ca and K. In contrast, pseudo-halophytes, facultative-halophytes and eury-hygro-halophytes, which often lack succulent shoots, showed low Na, S, and Mg and high Ca and K concentrations in their leaves. Clear patterns were identified among taxonomic families, with Chenopodiaceae and Plumbaginaceae having high Na and Mg and low Ca and K concentrations, Caryophyllaceae having high K, Poaceae having low Na, and Asteraceae, Boraginaceae, and Brassicaceae showing high foliar Ca concentrations. We conclude that the elemental composition of halophytes and pseudo-halophytes is related to salt-tolerance categories, eco-morphological types and respective taxonomic groups. © 2019 Elsevier Masson SAS</abstract></record></records></xml>
