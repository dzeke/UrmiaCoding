Our Findings Show That Increasing Water Withdrawal In Iran, Due To Population Growth And Increased Agricultural Activities, Has Been The Main Source Of Historical Water Stress. Increased Levels Of Water Stress Across Iran Are Expected To Continue Or Even Worsen Over The Next Decades Due To Projected Variability And Change In Precipitation Combined With Heightened Water Withdrawals Due To Increasing Population And Socio-Economic Activities. The Greatest Rate Of Decreased Water Storage Is Expected In The Urmia Basin, Northwest Of Iran, (Varying From ~ 8.3Mm/Year In 20102039 To ~ 61.6Mm/Year In 20702099 Compared With An Observed Rate Of 4Mm/Year In 19762005). Human Activities, However, Strongly Dominate The Effects Of Precipitation Variability And Change. Major Shifts Toward Sustainable Land And Water Management Are Needed To Reduce The Impacts Of Water Scarcity In The Future, Particularly In Irans Heavily Stressed Basins Like Urmia Basin, Which Feeds The Shrinking Lake Urmia. 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Na, Climate Change, Climate Models, Digital Storage, Economics, Population Statistics, Precipitation (Meteorology), Water Management, Water Supply, Agricultural Activities, Climatic Changes, Ground-Based Data, Population Growth, Precipitation Variability, Sustainable Lands, Water Availability, Water Withdrawal, Surface Waters, Climate Change, Climate Modeling, Human Activity, Nature-Society Relations, Population Growth, Precipitation (Climatology), Socioeconomic Conditions, Surface Water, Water Availability, Water Storage, Water Stress, Water Use Efficiency, Iran, Lake Urmia",1,10.1007/S10584-018-2336-6,379-391,Scopus,152,2019

The Overarching Goal Of This Paper Is To Set A Framework For Deriving Dynamic, Climate-Informed Environmental Inflows For Drying Lakes Considering Both Meteorological/Climatic And Anthropogenic Conditions. We Report On The Compounding Effects Of Meteorological Drought And Unsustainable Water Resource Management That Contributed To Lake Urmia'S Contemporary Environmental Catastrophe. Using Rich Datasets Of Hydrologic Attributes, Water Demands And Withdrawals, As Well As Water Management Infrastructure (I.E. Reservoir Capacity And Operating Policies), We Provide A Quantitative Assessment Of The Basin'S Water Resources, Demonstrating That Lake Urmia Reached A Tipping Point In The Early 2000S. The Lake Level Failed To Rebound To Its Designated Ecological Threshold (1274 M Above Sea Level) During A Relatively Normal Hydro-Period Immediately After The Drought Of Record (1998-2002). The Collapse Was Caused By A Marked Overshoot Of The Basin'S Hydrologic Capacity Due To Growing Anthropogenic Drought In The Face Of Extreme Climatological Stressors. We Offer A Dynamic Environmental Inflow Plan For Different Climate Conditions (Dry, Wet And Near Normal), Combined With Three Representative Water Withdrawal Scenarios. Assuming Effective Implementation Of The Proposed 40% Reduction In The Current Water Withdrawals, The Required Environmental Inflows Range From 2900 Million Cubic Meters Per Year (Mcm Yr1) During Dry Conditions To 5400 Mcm Yr1 During Wet Periods With The Average Being 4100 Mcm Yr1. Finally, For Different Environmental Inflow Scenarios, We Estimate The Expected Recovery Time For Re-Establishing The Ecological Level Of Lake Urmia. 2018 The Author(S).

The Results Are Compared With Modern Topography, Tectonic And Palaeoclimatic History, And Recent Phylogenetic Data To Explain The Extremely High Speciation Rate And Level Of Endemism As Well As The Modern Geographical Distribution Of The Genus. Cousinia Is Consistently Well-Represented In Glacial-Age And Late-Glacial Pollen Assemblages Of Nw Iran And E Anatolia. In The ~. 200,000-Year Pollen Sequence From Lake Urmia, Nw Iran, Cousinia Pollen Shows Significant Values And Is Nearly Continuously Represented During Both The Last Glacial (~ 70. Ka To Holocene) And Penultimate Glacial Periods (~. 190 To 130. Ka). In Contrast, Its Pollen Is Less Frequent And Occurs Only Sporadically During The Last Interglacial Period And The Holocene. This Pattern Suggests That Cousinia Could Not Only Withstand Quaternary Glaciations, But Was A Significant Part Of The Glacial-Age Landscapes Of The Irano-Turanian Territory. We Argue That The Extremely High Rate Of Speciation And Endemism Of Cousinia Is Due To (I) The Continuous Presence Of A Complex Topography In The Middle East And Central Asia Since Tertiary Times, Which Created A Wide Range Of Environmental Niches And Facilitated The Formation And Persistence Of Isolated Populations Over Long Periods, (Ii) Relatively Stable Climate During The Late Miocene-Pliocene Compared To The Quaternary Period That Caused Small Species Range Shifts And Gene Flow, And (Iii) A Dampened Impact Of Multiple Glacial-Interglacial Cycles On The Mountain Regions Of Sw Asia Compared To The Higher Latitude European Mountain Ranges.

The Analysis Accounts For The Relationships Between Atmospheric Climate Change (Precipitation P, Temperature T), And Hydrological (Soil Moisture Sm, And Wl) And Vegetation Cover (Vc, Including Agricultural Crops And Other Vegetation) Changes In The Landscape. Results Show That P, T, And Sm Changes Cannot Explain The Sharp Decline In Lake Wl Since 2000. Instead, The Agricultural Increase Of Vc In The Watershed Correlates Well With The Lake Wl Change, Indicating This Human-Driven Vc And Associated Irrigation Expansion As The Dominant Human Driver Of The Lake Urmia Desiccation. Specifically, The Greater Transpiration From The Expanded And Increasingly Irrigated Agricultural Crops Implies Increased Total Evapotranspiration And Associated Consumptive Use Of Water (Inherently Related To The Irrigation And Water Diversion And Storage Developments In The Watershed).

Microbial Iron Reduction Plays An Important Role In The Iron Cycle And Affects The Exchange Of Nutrients And Trace Elements In Ecosystems. Dissimilatory Reduction Of Ferric Iron Oxides Plays An Important Role In Mineralization Of Organic Materials In Anoxic Soils And Sediments And Also Makes Up An Important Fraction Of Anaerobic Carbon Metabolism In Special Marine And Freshwater Environments. Some Bacteria And Archaea Can Grow Anaerobically Using Fe(Iii) As The Sole Electron Acceptor And Some Fungi Also Are Able To Reduce Fe(Iii) To Fe(Ii). In This Study, Iron Reduction Was Investigated Using Bacterial Isolates Tbz9 And Tbz23, Isolated From Urmia Lake In Iran. Differential Pulse Polarography Was Exploited To Measure Different Reduced Forms Of Iron In Control And Treated Samples. The Results Showed That Both Isolates Are Able To Reduce Fe(Iii) To Fe(Ii) And Fe(Ii) To Metallic Fe. Based On Intensity Of Differential Pulse Polarogram Peaks Observed Respectively At - 0.34V And -0.51 V, It Seems That Tbz23 Reduces Almost 14.11% Of Available Fe(Iii) To Fe(Ii) And This Reduction Rate Is About 72.12% For Tbz9 During 10 Days Of Incubation. The Rate Of Reducing Fe(Ii) To Metallic Fe Is Seemingly 21.14% For Tbz23 And 64.79% For Tbz9 During 10 Days Of Incubation. Therefore, Isolate Tbz9 Is An Environmental Bacterium With Higher Potential To Reduce Ferric Iron To Ferrous Iron And Also To Reduce Ferrous Iron To Metallic Iron.

Relatively Low Values Of Arboreal Pollen (Ap), And Substantial Values Of Artemisia Pollen From 2550 To 1500 Cal Bp Indicate The Prevalence Of Steppe Vegetation And Relatively Arid Climate In The Area. However, A Prominent Peak Of Riella Spores May Indicate A Short-Lived Lake-Level Rise For The Period 1900-2000 Cal Bp. The Next Period, 1500-550 Cal Bp, Is Characterized By Substantial Rise In Ap, Particularly Quercus. , And A Sharp Decline Of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae And Wetland Pollen Types, Suggesting The Expansion Of Oak Forests Under A Rather Moist Climate And/Or A Decline In Agro-Sylvo-Pastoral Practices In The Area.

The Rise Of Saline Habitat Pollen Types Between 1100 And 800 Cal Bp, Along With Increased Values Of Magnetic Susceptibility And Organic Matter, Suggest A Lower Water Level And The Subaerial Exposure Of Saline Mud Flats, Which Could Favour The Re-Colonization Of Chenopods And Other Halophytes Around The Margins Of The Lake.

The Lake Has Been Facing A Serious Environmental Crisis, Due To Water Mismanagement In The Basin. To Address This Problem, An Analysis Of The Hydrodynamic Behavior And Of Salinity Distribution Is Important. The Three-Dimensional Numerical Model Mike 3 Flow Model Fm Was Employed In This Study. Model Sensitivity Analyses Revealed That Wind Speed, Friction Coefficient, And Vertical Eddy Viscosity Are Effective Parameters On Both Flow Velocities And Salinity Distribution, While Bottom Roughness Height Has Minor Effects On Surface Velocities. Reduced Value For Vertical Eddy Viscosity Improves The Simulation Of The Velocity Field And Has An Adverse Effect On Salinity Distribution. The Unesco Density Function Leads To An Overestimation Of Density. Yet, Final Model Results Are Accurate Enough To Reproduce The Salinity Distribution Over The Lake, Revealing That The Salinity Difference Between North And South Basins Of Lake Urmia Increases Significantly In The Wet Season, Due To Southern Rivers Inflows By Snowmelt.

We Applied X-Ray Fluorescence And Scanning Electron Microscopy (Sem) Methods To Characterize Sediments From Western Rivers In The Urmia Lake Basin In Iran With A Particular Focus On Properties That Are Relevant To P Speciation. Phosphorous Pools Were Sequentially Extracted Into Operationally Defined Exchangeable (Exch-P), Iron And Aluminum Oxide-Bound (Fe/Al-P), Calcium-Bound (Ca-P), And Residual (Res-P) P Pools. In River Sediments, The Size Of P Pool Was Found To Be In The Order Of Ca-P &Gt, Res-P &Gt, Fe/Al-P &Gt, Exch-P Indicating Small Fraction Of Bioavailable P Pool And Ca-P Minerals Being The Most Dominant P Sink. Carbonate-Related Properties Had An Inverse Relationship With Bioavailable P Pools In The River Sediments Studied.

However, Some Issues (Like The Autocorrelation Or The Proper Definition Of The Multivariate Index) Are Still Open And Need To Be Addressed To Make These Indices Applicable In Current Practice. Here, A Composite Agrometeorological Drought Index (Amdi-Sa) Has Been Introduced, Accounting For Meteorological And Agricultural Droughts, Considering Specifically Seasonality And Autocorrelation. The Amdi-Sa Combines, Through The Copula Concept And The Kendall Function, Two Drought Indices [Namely Multivariate Standardized Precipitation Index (Mspi) And The Multivariate Standardized Soil Moisture Index (Mssi)] In A Statistically Consistent (Normal Distributed) Drought Indicator. Nonparametric Distributions Have Been Used For The Variables Of Interest And The Calculation Of Mspi And Mssi, Whereas Parametric And Nonparametric (Empirical) Copulas Are Used To Build The Amdi-Sa. A Prewhitening Procedure Has Been Applied To The Mspi And Mssi To Remove The Autocorrelation.

The Model Results Show That Decreases In Inflow Generally Follow Observed Decreases In Precipitation, Although The Variability In Inflow Is More Pronounced Than The Variability In Precipitation. The Results Also Suggest That Water Use For Irrigation Has Increased Pressure On The Basin'S Water Availability And Has Caused Flows To Decrease By As Much As 40% During Dry Years. On The Other Hand, The Presence Of Reservoirs Positively Contributed To Water Availability During Relatively Dry Years And Did Not Significantly Reduce Lake Inflow. By Accelerating Irrigation Expansion In The Basin, Reservoirs Have, However Indirectly, Contributed To Inflow Reduction. Our Results Show That Annual Inflow To Urmia Lake Has Dropped By 48% Over The Study Period. About Three Fifths Of This Change Was Caused By Climate Change And About Two Fifths Was Caused By Water Resource Development.

Shores Are Special Zones That Are In Contact With Three Atmosphere, Hydrosphere And Lithosphere Environments Of Earth. Shore Lines Are Of The Most Important Linear Features Of The Earth'S Surface Which Have An Animated And Alive Nature. In This Regard, Optimized Management Of The Shores And Environmental Protection For Stable Development Require Observing The Shorelines And Their Variations. Protection Of Shorelines Within Appropriate Time Periods Is Of High Importance For The Purpose Of Optimized Management Of The Shores. The Twenty First Century Has Been Called The Era Of Information Explosion. A Time That, Through Benefits Of New Technologies, Information Experts Attempt To Generate More And Up To Date Information In Various Fields And To Provide Them For Managers And Decision Makers In Order To Be Considered For Future Planning And Also To Assist The Planners To Arrange And Set A Comprehensive Plan. Aerial Images And Remote Sensing Technology Are Economic Methods To Acquire The Required Data. Such Methods Are Free From Common Time And Place Limitations In Survey Based Methods. Among Remote Sensing Data, The Ones Acquired From Optical Images Have Several Benefits Which Include Low Cost, Interpretation Simplicity And Ease Of Access. That Is Why Most Of The Researches Concerning Extraction Of Shorelines Are Practiced Using Optical Images. On The Other Hand, Wide Range Coverage Of Satellite Images Along With Rapid Access To Them Caused These Images To Be Used Extensively For Extracting The Shorelines. The Attempt In This Research Is To Use Satellite Images And Their Application In Order To Study Variations Of The Shorelines. Thus, For This Purpose, Landsat Satellite Images From Tm And Etm+ Sensors In The 35 Time Period Has Been Used. In Order To Reach Better Results, Images From Modis Satellite Has Been Used As Auxiliary Data For The Images That Are With An Error Margin. Initial Classification On The Images Was Conducted To Distinguish Water And Non Water Applications. Neural Network Classification Was Applied With Specific Scales On The Images And The Two Major Applications Were Thereby Extracted. Then, In Order To Authenticate The Proceedings, Error Matrix And Kappa Coefficient Has Been Applied On The Classified Images. Base Pixel Method Of Neural Network Was Used For The Purpose Of Information Extraction While Authenticity Of That Was Evaluated Too. The Outcomes Display The Trend Of Urmia Shoreline Has Been Approximately Constant Between The Years Of 1976 To 1995 And Has Experienced Very Low Variations. In 1998 The Lake Experienced Increase Of Water And Therefore Advancement Of The Shoreline Of The Lake Due To Increase Of Precipitation And The Volume Of Inflowing Water To The Basin. During 2000 To 20125, However, The Lake'S Shoreline Has Experienced A Downward Trend, Which Was Intensified In 2007 And Reached To Its Most Critical Level Ever Since, That Is Decreasing To About One Third. Further, Temporal And Spatial Potentiality Evaluation Of Clouds Seeding In Urmia Lake Zone Has Been Studied As A Solution For Improvement And Recovery Of The Current Status Of The Lake, And An Algorithm Was Proposed For Optimized Temporal- Spatial Study On Could Seeding. Ecological, Meteorological And Synoptic Data Were Used For Timing Study Of The Cloud'S Seeding Plan, Which Upon Study, It Is Easy To Evaluate Precipitation Potential And Quality Of The System. At The Next Step, The Rate Of Humidity And Also Stability Of The Precipitating System Can Be Analyzed Using Radar Acquired Data. Whereas Extracted Date From Modis Images Are Expressing The Spatial Position, Therefore In Order To Study The Location Of The Cloud'S Seeding, Modis Images Of The Selected Time Intervals Along With Applying Mcm Algorithm Were Used To Conclude Thick Clouds. Also, With Interpolation Of The Trmm Data, It Is Possible To Deduce Maximum Precipitation In The Form Of Spatial Arena. One Of The Data Categories That Is Used Both For Temporal And Spatial Analysis Is Radar Images Which In Addition To Time, Displays The Existing Humidity Range, Movement Direction, And Positions Of Accumulated Precipitation Cores. Therefore, Using This Algorithm, It Is Possible To Conclude The Most Optimized Spatial Position In Order To Execute The Seeding Plan.","Landsat Satellite, Neural Network, Shoreline Changes, Temporal- Spatial Potentiality Evaluation, Urmia Lake, Climate Change, Cloud Seeding, Decision Making, Earth Atmosphere, Geometrical Optics, Image Classification, Lakes, Neural Networks, Precipitation (Meteorology), Quality Control, Radar, Radiometers, Remote Sensing, Satellite Imagery, Satellites, Space-Based Radar, Information Explosion, Landsat Satellite, Landsat Satellite Images, Neural Network Classification, Remote Sensing Technology, Shoreline Change, Technology Development, Temporal- Spatial Potentiality Evaluation, Image Processing",0,10.5194/ISPRSARCHIVES-XL-1-W5-15-2015,15-30,Scopus,40,2015

Article,"Ahmadzadeh, H//Morid, S//Delavar, M//Srinivasan, R",Using The Swat Model To Assess The Impacts Of Changing Irrigation From Surface To Pressurized Systems On Water Productivity And Water Saving In The Zarrineh Rud Catchment,Agricultural Water Management,"Considering Global Water Scarcity, Especially In The Agricultural Sector, Many Attempts Are Being Made To Improve Water Productivity And Save More Water. Changing Irrigation Systems From Surface To Pressurized Has Been One Of The Considerable Actions In This Regard. However, Any Attempts To Do So Must Be Evaluated In An Integrated Perspective At The Basin Level By Means Of Relevant Agro-Hydrological Models Before Making Them Operational. This Paper Aims To Address This Issue By Using The Soil And Water Assessment Tool (Swat). Zarrineh Rud River, The Main Feeding River Of Northwest Iran'S Lake Urmia, Is Selected As The Case Study For Exploring This Methodology. This Lake Has Been Shrinking Since 1995, And To Save Water And Increase The Basin'S Water Productivity, Improvement Of Pressurized Systems Is Considered As A Solution. Swat Cannot Directly Simulate Changing The Irrigation System From Surface To Pressurized. In This Study, We Use The Innovative Approach Of Applying The Model To Simulate Different Irrigation Systems Considering Real Irrigation Management Variables Such As Depth And Date Of Each Irrigation Event. Also, In Order To Improve Its Performance In Simulation Of Such Systems, A Comprehensive Calibration Procedure Was Used Based On A Wide Range Of Data For Hydrological And Agricultural Variables. The Results Showed That Changing The Current Irrigation To A Pressurized System Can Increase Water Productivity Up To 15% Due To Increases In Crop Yield, Better Water Distribution And Greater Actual Evapotranspiration. However, Pressurized Irrigation Results In No Significant Change In Total Inflow To The Lake. Notably, These Systems Can Intensify Drawdown Of The Basin'S Water Table Up To 20%. So, Any Significant Real Water Saving Program In The Basin Must Be Associated With Reduction Of Evapotranspiration By Adopting Measures Like Reducing Cultivated Areas, Changing Cropping Patterns To Less Water Consuming Plants, Or Applying Deficit Irrigation. The Applied Methodology Of This Paper As Well As The Comprehensive Calibration And Setup Of The Swat Model With The Readily Available Hydrological And Agricultural Variables Can Be A Good Sample For Similar Works.

Article,"Alemohammad, S//Yavari, Ar//Salehi, S//Zebardast, L",Using The Strategic Environmental Assessment For Compilation Polices Of Sustainable Development Plan In Lake Urmia,Journal Of Environmental Studies,"Introduction: Average Per-Capita Renewable Water Of Iran Is Decreasing Strongly. In Near Future Water Wars In The Middle East Are Predictable. Exploitation Of Land Resource Has The Most Significant Impact On Wetlands. Wetlands Degradation Is The Serious Warning To Unsustainable Development. Despite That The Lake Urmia Is Recorded In Conservation Lists As Iranian National Parks, Ramsar Sites And Unesco Biosphere Reserves, Over The Past Decade, Change Detection In This Land Indicates The Regression Of Water Level. Geology Studies Such As Sediment, Pale Limnology And Hydro Geochemistry Have Shown The Role Of Climate In Drying Of Urmia Lake With Serious Uncertainty. Testimonies Indicate That Urmia Lake During The Holocene Wasn'T Dry Except In Shoreline. Unsustainable Future For Environmental And Socio-Economic Dimensions Of This Land Is Predictable. Thus, Investigation About The Ways Of Utilization Water Resources In Basic Needs (Especially Water And Soil) In Urmia Watershed Seems Necessary. In Macroscopic And Coarse Scales, Sustainable Development Policy Making Needs Strategic Environmental Assessment (Sea) Approach. Integrated Management Plan For Watershed Of Lake Urmia Is Single Plan In Urmia Basin Scale. This Plan Doesn'T Have Necessary Strategies For Resource Management And Has A Lot Of Ambiguities And Faults. Moreover, Resource Management Of This Land Didn'T Have Requisite Strategies. This Study Will Identify Causal Chains Of Land Degradation With Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (Dpsir) Model. Then, Policies Are Collected In Order To Protect Natural Resources, The Area, And The Profits Of Local Residual And Future Generations With Sea Approach. Sea Studies Have Just Begun In Iran, So This Study Has Much Educational And Investigative Value. Materials And Methods: Urmia Lake Is Located At The End Of Closed Endorheic Basin Of Urmia In North West Iranian Plateau. This Basin Has Nine Watersheds. Two Watersheds Are Situated On Ecological Zone. This Study Is Based On Description And Systematic Analysis By Using Quantitative And Qualitative Data In Sea Framework And Policy Making Category. Screening And Scoping Stages Are Noted To Understand State Of Environment And Completion Of Socio-Economic Baseline Studies. Screening Stage Is Noted To Initial Environmental Evaluation By Using Dpsir Model. This Model Defines The Association Between Environmental Processes And Environmental Impact With Human Activities. In Scoping Stage, Important Scales, Variable Ecological Components, And Variable Social Components Have Been Distinguished. Type Of These Variable Components Is Descriptive Indicator. Then, Preconditions Of Participation Have Been Mentioned. In This Stage, Long-Term Strategic Goals (Responding To Driving Forces In Basin Scale) With Vision Outlining (1415) And Middle-Term Strategic Goals (Responding To Pressure In Watershed Scale And Responding To State Of Ecological Zone) With Vision Outlining (1405) Has Been Determined In Order To Specify Sustainable Development Planning In This Land. In Evaluation Stage, Priority Of Watersheds Has Been Determined For Related Policies According To Variable Components. Appropriate Strategies For Decision Making And Monitoring Process Have Been Proposed. Finally, Optimum Mixture Of Policies Has Been Suggested For Sustainable Development Of This Land. Discussion And Results: The Role Of Human Activities In Degradation Of This Land (Urmia Basin) Is Indisputable. Land Degradation Driving Forces Are As Follows: 1. The Rapid Growth Of Urban Population, 2. Lack Of Appropriate Planning To Meet Population Needs, 3. Major And Nonproductive Employment In Agricultural Sector, 4. Low Literacy And Old Age In Farmers With Lands Reformation And Consequently Patches Fragmentation And Decreasing Production Efficiency, 5. Focus On Water Supply Approach And Dam Making In Water Resource Management, 6. Government Incumbency And Facilitating In Distribution Of Agricultural Inputs, Particularly Watersector Such As Hidden Subsidies Of Government For Water Supply By Lack Of Proper Water Pricing, 7. Lack Of Participation Of Agricultural Land Use Integrated Management Due To Participation Preconditions In Iran (Government Reliance On Oil Revenue), Thus Decision Making For Using Land Resource Is Merely Government-Owned. The Most Important Pressure Of Human Activity Is Also As Follows: 1. Construction Of Road Through The Middle Of The Lake And Consequently Water Flow Disorder. 2. Irregular Dam Making And Consequently Silent Rivers. 3. Land Cover Changes And Land Use Conversions. 4. Changes In Cultivation Pattern And Consequently Consuming More Water. 5. Serious Irrigation Deficiency. 6. Drilling Numerous Wells And Exploitation Of Underground Water Beyond The Limit Of The Water Tables. 7. Non Principal Faulty Salt Exploitation And Consequently Dust Aggravation. Conclusion: These Pressures Lead To Dominant Positive Feedbacks, Climatic Disturbances And Weather Quality Decadence, Quality And Quantity Of Water Resource And Decreasing And Degradation Of Natural Habitats. Finally, This Land Degradation Will Lead To Increase In Unemployment, Immigration, Social Insecurity And Protestation And Diseases. This Study By Using Sea In Urmia Watershed, Has Compiled Sustainable Development Policies. The Main Advantage Of This Study Is Incorporation Of The Results Of Sea And Dpsir.

Discontinuous And Sometimes Irreversible Changes, Called 'Regime Shifts' Or 'Critical Transitions', Can Occur. The Likelihood Of Such Shifts Is Expected To Increase For A Variety Of Ecosystems, And It Is Difficult To Predict How Close An Ecosystem Is To A Critical Transition. Recent Modelling Studies Identified Indicators Of Impending Regime Shifts That Can Be Used To Provide Early Warning Signals Of A Critical Transition. The Identification Of Such Transitions Crucially Depends On The Ability To Monitor Key Ecosystem Variables, And Their Success May Be Limited By Lack Of Appropriate Data. Moreover, Empirical Demonstrations Of The Actual Functioning Of These Indicators In Real-World Ecosystems Are Rare. This Paper Presents The First Study Which Uses Remote Sensing Data To Identify A Critical Transition In A Wetland Ecosystem. In This Study, We Argue That A Time Series Of Remote Sensing Data Can Help To Characterize And Determine The Timing Of A Critical Transition. This Can Enhance Our Abilities To Detect And Anticipate Them.

In Addition, As A Control Case, We Applied The Same Methods To Another Wetland Ecosystem In Lake Arpi, Armenia Which Did Not Experience A Regime Shift. We Propose A New Composite Index (Mvwr) Based On Combining Vegetation And Water Indices, Which Can Improve The Ability To Anticipate A Critical Transition In A Wetland Ecosystem.

However, The Lake Has Been Shrinking Rapidly Over The Last 20 Years, Primarily Due To Anthropogenic Influences, While Climate Change Has Had Also A Detectable Influence. Climate Change And Anthropohenic Impacts On The Rapid Shrinkage Of Lake Urmia Are Investigated Using Long-Term Surface Meteorological Records Of Weather Stations, While The Number Of Constructed Dams And Expansion Of Irrigated Areas In The Urmia Basin Are Also Examined. Over The Past Few Decades, A Warming Trend Of The Order 0.18 C Decade1 Has Been Identified, While Precipitation Has Been Decreasing By Approximately 9 Mm Decade1 Over The Basin. As A Consequence Of Such Significant Warming, Evaporation From The Lake Has Been Increasing By The Rate Of 6.2 Mm Decade1. The Increased Air Temperature And Evaporation, Along With The Decreased Precipitation Indicate That Lake Urmia Has Been Experiencing Meteorological Drought Conditions. The Main Anthropogenic Influence, On The Other Hand, Has Been Overwhelming Diversion Of Water Sources For Irrigation, Which Led To The Socioeconomic Drought Of The Region Because Demand For Water Has Exceeded The Supply. The Meteorological Drought, Combined By The Socioeconomic Drought, Have Contributed To The Significant Shrinkage Of Lake Urmia, Started From The Mid 1990S Water Level Peak, Although The Latter Has Had The Most Significant Contribution.

This Work Investigated The Seasonal Hydrochemical Evolution Of Coastal Groundwater Resources In Urmia Plain, Nw Iran. Two Recently Proposed Methods Have Been Used To Comparison, Recognize And Understand The Temporal And Spatial Evolution Of Saltwater Intrusion In A Coastal Alluvial Aquifer. The Study Takes Into Account That Saltwater Intrusion Is A Dynamic Process, And That Seasonal Variations In The Balance Of The Aquifer Cause Changes In Groundwater Chemistry. Pattern Diagrams, Which Constitute The Outcome Of Several Hydrochemical Processes, Have Traditionally Been Used To Characterize Vulnerability To Sea/Saltwater Intrusion. However, The Formats Of Such Diagrams Do Not Facilitate The Geospatial Analysis Of Groundwater Quality, Thus Limiting The Ability Of Spatio-Temporal Mapping And Monitoring. This Deficiency Calls For Methodologies Which Can Translate Information From Some Diagrams Such Piper Diagram Into A Format That Can Be Mapped Spatially.

Subsequently, Analysis Of The Spatial Distribution Of Hydrochemical Facies Using Heatmaps Helps To Identify The General State Of The Aquifer With Respect To Saltwater Intrusion During Different Sampling Periods.

The Poor Correlation Between Sampling Depth And Cl Concentrations Indicated That The Position Of Freshwater-Saltwater Interface Is Not Uniformly Distributed In The Study Area, And This Was Attributed To Aquifer Heterogeneities. The Targeted Coastal Wells Showed B/Cl And Br/Cl Molar Ratios In The Range Of 0.00222.43 And 0.000320.28, Respectively. The Base-Exchange Index (Bei) And Saturation Index (Si) Calculations Showed That The Salinization Process Followed By Cation-Exchange Reactions Mainly Controls Changes In The Chemical Composition Of Groundwater. All Groundwater Samples Are Depleted With Respect To 18O (11.71 To 9.4 ) And D (66.26 To 48.41 ). The 18O And D Isotope Ratios For Surface And Groundwater Had A Similar Range And Showed High Deuterium Excess (D-Excess) (21.11 To 31.16 ). The High D-Excess In Water Samples Is Because Of Incoming Vapors From The Ul Mixed With An Evaporated Moisture Flux From The Urmia Mainland And Incoming Vapors From The West (I.E., Mediterranean Sea). Some Saline Samples With Low B/Cl And Br/Cl Ratios Had Depleted 18O And D. In This Case, Due To Freshwater Flushing, The Drilled Wells In The Coastal Playas And Salty Sediments Could Have More Depleted Isotopes, More Cl, And Consequently Smaller B/Cl And Br/Cl Ratios.

Article,"Amiri, V//Nakhaei, M//Lak, R//Kholghi, M","Investigating The Salinization And Freshening Processes Of Coastal Groundwater Resources In Urmia Aquifer, Nw Iran",Environmental Monitoring And Assessment,"This Paper Presents The Results Of An Assessment About Interaction Between Urmia Lake (Ul) And Coastal Groundwater In The Urmia Aquifer (Ua). This Aquifer Is The Most Significant Contributor To The Freshwater Supply Of The Coastal Areas. The Use Of Hydrochemical Facies Can Be Very Useful To Identify The Saltwater Encroachment Or Freshening Phases In The Coastal Aquifers. In This Study, The Analysis Of Salinization/Freshening Processes Was Carried Out Through The Saturation Index (Si), Ionic Deltas (), Binary Diagrams, And Hydrochemical Facies Evolution (Hfe) Diagram. Based On The Gibbs Plot, The Behavior Of The Major Ions Showed That The Changes In The Chemical Composition Of The Groundwater Are Mainly Controlled By The Water-Soil/Rock Interaction Zone And Few Samples Are Relatively Controlled By Evaporation. A Possible Explanation For This Phenomenon Is That The Deposited Chloride And Sulfate Particles Can Form The Minor Salinity Source In Some Coastal Areas When Washed Down By Precipitation. The Si Calculations Showed That All Groundwater Samples, Collected In These Periods, Show Negative Saturation Indices, Which Indicate Undersaturation With Respect To Anhydrite, Gypsum, And Halite. In Addition, Except In A Few Cases, All Other Samples Showed The Undersaturation With Respect To The Carbonate Minerals Such As Aragonite, Calcite, And Dolomite. Therefore, These Minerals Are Susceptible To Dissolution. In The Dry Season, The Si Calculations Showed More Positive Values With Respect To Dolomite, Especially In The Northern Part Of Ua, Which Indicated A Higher Potential For Precipitation And Deposition Of Dolomite.

It Has Been Suggested That The Desiccation Is Caused By Intensified Human Activities, Especially Irrigation, And Prolonged Droughts In The Lake Basin, But There Is A Lack Of Quantitative Analysis To Attribute The Observed Water Level Decline To Natural And Anthropogenic Causes. In This Study, We Use Remote Sensing Data, Ground Observations, And A Hydrological Model With Human Impact Assessment Capabilities (Higw-Mat) To Investigate The Natural And Human-Induced Changes In The Hydrology Of Urmia Lake Basin From 1980 To 2010. Based On The Analysis Of Remote Sensing Data, We Find A 98% And 180% Increase In Agricultural Lands And Urban Areas, Respectively, From 1987 Through 2016, With A Corresponding Shrinkage In Lake Area By 86%. Further, We Use Model Results To Examine The Changes In Terrestrial Water Storage (Tws) Over The Basin Including The Lake. Results Indicate That Tws Declined Over The Lake Region And The Lake Lost Water At A Faster Rate Than The Watershed Did. Comparison Of River Inflow To The Lake From Two Simulationsone With And The Other Without Human Activitiessuggests That Human Water Management Activities Caused A Reduction In Streamflow Of 1.74 Km3/Year From 1995 To 2010, Which Accounts For 86% Of The Total Depletion In Lake Volume During The Same Period.

Most Countries Do Not Have A Precise Measurement Of Water Consumption For Irrigation. In This Study, An Innovative Approach Is Proposed That Allows For Estimation Of Irrigation Water Use At The Catchment Scale Based On Satellite Soil Moisture Data. To This End, The Sm2Rain Algorithm, Which Had Been Originally Developed For Estimation Of Rainfall From The Soil Moisture Observations, Is Adopted. The Satellite Soil Moisture Observations Obtained From Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (Amsr2) Along With Different Rainfall And Evapotranspiration (Et) Products In The Period 20122015 Are Used As The Input To The Model. The Methodology Is Tested In The Agricultural Plains Of Southern Urmia Lake, Which Is One Of The Main Agricultural Plains In Iran For Which Actual Irrigation Data Is Available. The Results Reveal That The Proposed Approach Can Capture The Overall Irrigation Pattern, Although, It Is Systematically Overestimating Irrigation Volume Compared To Observed Irrigation Data. Thus The Bias Is Calculated Over Largely Non-Irrigated Pixels And Used To Modify The Model Estimates. The Bias-Corrected Results Show Good Agreement With The In Situ Irrigation Data. In Particular, The Average Model Performance In The Irrigated Pixels In Terms Of R And Rmse (Mm/Month) Are (0.86 And 12.895) Respectively. Accuracy Varied Depending On The Inputs, With Improvement In Order Of 11% And 42% In R And Rmse Depending On The Inputs Chosen. The Method Is Also Applied To Less Irrigated Areas That Result In Obtaining Significantly Lower Irrigation Rates.

In Recent Decades, The Water Level Of The Largest Lake In Iran, Urmia Lake, Has Decreased Sharply, Which Has Become A Major Environmental Concern In Iran And The Region. The Efforts To Revive The Lake Concerns The Amount Of Water Required For Restoration. This Study Monitored And Assessed Urmia Lake Status Over A Period Of 30Years (1984 To 2014) Using Remotely Sensed Data. A Novel Method Is Proposed That Generates A Lakebed Digital Elevation Model (Lbdem) For Urmia Lake Based On Time Series Images From Landsat Satellites, Water Level Field Measurements, Remote Sensing Techniques, Gis, And 3D Modeling. The Volume Of Water Required To Restore The Lake Water Level To That Of Previous Years And The Ecological Water Level Was Calculated Based On Lbdem. The Results Indicate A Marked Change In The Area And Volume Of The Lake From Its Maximum Water Level In 1998 To Its Minimum Level In 2014. During This Period, 86% Of The Lake Became A Salt Desert And The Volume Of The Lake Water In 2013 Was Just 0.83% Of The 1998 Volume. The Volume Of Water Required To Restore Urmia Lake From Benchmark Status (In 2014) To Ecological Water Level (1274.10M) Is 12.546Bm3, Excluding Evaporation.

The Lake Is The Main Habitat For The Endemic Iranian Brine Shrimp, Artemia Urmiana, And Is A Protected Aquatic Environment. Efforts Have Been Made By The Iranian Government To Enhance The Diversity Of Its Wildlife. One Approach Has Been To Look For A Method To Reduce The Salt Content Of The Lake. We Investigate The Feasibility Of This By First Considering The Water Chemistry Of Lake Urmia And Then The Various Technologies Used To Extract Salt From Marine And Brackish Waters. Average Concentrations Of Na, Mg, K, Ca, Cl, So4, And Hco3 Were 125G/L, 11.3G/L, 2.63G/L, 0.55G/L, 216G/L, 22.4G/L, And 1.38G/L, Respectively, And Cations And Anions Were Balanced, However, Lake Urmia Waters Have A 'Very High' Salinity Hazard And A High Sodium Adsorption Ratio (Sar). Moreover, The Saturation Index (Si) For Each Of The Major Cations Was Greater Than Zero, Indicating That The Water In Lake Urmia Is Supersaturated, And Precipitation Is Likely. The Extraction Of Available Salts From The Lake For The Use In Petrochemical Industries Is Economically Feasible. However, Technologies Based On Removing Salts By Distillation Or Reverse Osmosis And Then Using This Fresh Water To Dilute Lake Salinity Are Problematic. A Better Strategy Would Be Better To Allow More Fresh Water To Reach The Lake Rather Than Creating Fresh Water Through Reverse Osmosis And Distillations Processes. While Concerns Have Been Raised About The Salinity Tolerance Of A. Urmiana, It Has Successfully Tolerated Various Salinity Ranges From 166 To 340G/L, And So The Species Is Not Threatened, Unless The Lake Desiccates. Because The Lake Is Saturated With Salts, It Seems Unlikely That Salinity Could Increase Much Higher. 2010 Elsevier B.V.","Artemia, Desalination, Environment, Lake, Salinity, Urmia, Aquatic Environments, Artemia, Average Concentration, Brackish Water, Environment, Fresh Water, Hypersaline Lakes, Petrochemical Industry, Salinity, Salinity Tolerance, Salt Content, Saturation Index, Sodium Adsorption Ratio, Urmia, Water Chemistry, Adsorption, Calcium, Desalination, Distillation, Environmental Impact, Positive Ions, Reverse Osmosis, Salinity Measurement, Salts, Water, Water Filtration, Lakes, Adsorption, Aquatic Environment, Concentration (Composition), Crustacean, Desalination, Distillation, Endemic Species, Environmental Impact, Environmental Protection, Habitat Type, Hypersaline Environment, Ion Exchange, Osmosis, Petrochemical Industry, Precipitation (Chemistry), Salinity, Saturation, Sodium, Species Diversity, State Role, Tolerance, Water Chemistry, Wildlife Management, Iran, Lake Urmia, Artemia, Artemia Urmiana",54,10.1016/J.JGLR.2010.06.004,419-424,Scopus,36,2010

This Study Examines How Multiple Criteria Can Be Combined To Make The Best Selection. Selection Becomes More Difficult And Subjective When More Than Two Criteria Are Used To Determine The Best Distribution. Under These Conditions, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Is Necessary. In This Study, 12 Distributions Were Tested And Compared For Flood Frequency Analysis Based On Five Selection Criteria: Root Mean Square Error, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Statistic, Relative Average Bias, Modified Anderson-Darling Test, And Deviation In Skewness And Kurtosis. The Comparisons Are Made Using A Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making (Mcgdm) Based On Ordered Weighted Averaging (Owa). Two Preemptive Goal Programming Models Based On Variance And Entropy Methods For A Predetermined Level Of Optimism By A Group Of Decision-Makers, Determined The Weight Of The Owa Operator. The Model Was Applied To A Case Study Of Mahabad River, A Major River Flowing Into Lake Urmia In Northwestern Iran. A Sensitivity Analysis Of The Results Of Mcgdm Was Done By Changing The Degree Of Optimism Of The Decision-Makers. The Results Of Sensitivity Analysis Showed The Dependence Of The Rankings To The Optimism Degrees Of The Decision-Makers. The 3-Parameter Weibull (Wbl3) And Pearson Type 3 (Pe3) Distributions Had The Best Results For Mahabad River Flood Data. A Monte Carlo Simulation Was Conducted To Test The Ability Of The Models. It Was Concluded From The Findings Of The Simulation That The Pe3 Distribution Is The Most Appropriate For Short Sample Sizes, While Wbl3 Is Preferable For Larger Sample Sizes.

The Tasuj Plain Is One Of The 12 Marginal Plains Around Urmia Lake Which Is Currently Under A Critical Ecological Condition. In The Last Decades, The Tasuj Plain Aquifer Suffered From Severe Groundwater Level Declination And Caused Degradation Of Groundwater Quality. To Better Understand Hydrogeochemical Processes In The Tasuj Plain, This Study Adopted Graphical Methods And Multivariate Statistical Techniques To Analyze Groundwater Samples. A Total Of 504 Groundwater Samples Was Obtained From 34 Different Locations (Qanats, Wells, And Springs) Over 12 Years (1997-2009) And Analyzed For 15 Water Quality Parameters. From The Results, The Piper Diagram Indicated Four Groundwater Types And The Stiff Diagram Showed Eight Different Sources Of Groundwater Samples. The Durov Diagram Identified Five Major Hydrogeochemical Processes In The Aquifer. However, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (Hca) Identified Five Water Types In The Groundwater Samples Because Hca Was Able To Analyze More Chemical And Physical Data Than Graphical Methods. The Hca Result Was Checked By Discriminant Analysis And Found Consistency In All Samples That Were Classified Into Correct Groups. Using Factor Analysis, We Identified Three Factors That Accounted For 81.6% Of The Total Variance Of The Dataset. Based On The High Factor Loadings Of The Variables, Factors 1 And 2 Reflected The Natural Hydrogeochemical Processes And Factor 3 Explained The Effect Of Agricultural Fertilizers And Human Activities In The Tasuj Plain. Dendrograms From 2000 To 2009 Were Studied To Understand The Temporal Variation Of Groundwater Quality.

Drought Events For 20112040, 20412070, And 20712100 Were Analyzed Based On The Standardized Precipitation Index (Spi) And The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (Spei) And Were Compared With The Adopted Baseline Period (19762005). The Spi And Spei Were Calculated Using The Precipitation And Temperatures Obtained From The Second-Generation Canadian Earth System Model (Canesm2) Under Representative Concentration Pathway (Rcp) 2.6 And Rcp 8.5 As Optimistic And Pessimistic Scenarios Respectively. The Results Of Spi Analyses Revealed That Under Rcp 2.6 The Frequency Of Droughts Is Almost Constant While Under Rcp 8.5 Drought Frequency Increased Especially In The Period 20712100. The Calculated Sepi Under Both Scenarios And During All Future Periods Predict That The Frequency And Duration Of Droughts Will Increase. Generally, The Difference Between The Spi And Spei Is Related To The Input To Each Index. Spi Is Solely Based On Precipitation While The Spei Accounts For Both Precipitation And Potential Evapotranspiration (Pet). Under Global Warming And Changing Climate, The Significant Role Of Pet Was Highlighted. It Was Concluded That The Spei Outperformed The Spi For Drought Studies Under A Changing Climate.

Assessing The Precipitation Data Of Global Datasets Indicate That The Major Error In Precipitation Of Global Datasets Is Bias Error Which Means That They Can Recognise The Behaviour Of Precipitation Time Series But There Is A Difference In Estimation Of Precipitation Amount. To Diminish The Bias Error, Bias Correction (Bc) Was Done Before Evaluating The Datasets In Drought Monitoring. The Results Indicated That Gpcc Is The Most Suitable Dataset Over The Study Area For Drought Studies. In Addition, Results Revealed That There Is No Significant Difference Between Original And Bc Data In Drought Monitoring. For Example, In Nine-Month Spi, The Critical Success Index (Csi) For Original Cru And Cru-Bc Were Equal To 71 And 76%, Respectively, And The Gpcc And Udel In Both Original And Bc Versions Were Equal To 88 And 55%, Respectively. Also, It Can Be Claim That The Bias Error Is Not Important In Drought Studies Due To The Fact That During Calculation Of Spi, Standardisation Process Will Remove Bias Significantly.

The Economical And Social Importance Of The Connection Between The Population Centers In Both Sides Of The Lake Has Encouraged The Construction Of A Causeway, Which Consequently Has Been Divided The Lake Into Northern And Southern Parts. Thus, The Navigational And Hydrological Links Have Been Limited To A Gap. The Aim Of This Paper Is To Study The Impacts Of The Division Of The Lake In Water Quality Parameters Such As Salinity And Sediment Concentration And The Efficiency Of The Implemented Gap In Connecting Two Parts Using Remotely Sensed Data. The Multitemporal Landsat Images Were Used In Order To Observe The Spatial And Temporal Variations Of Water Quality Parameters. The Preliminary Examinations Of The Image Data Have Shown That Some Patterns Could Be Detected Through Using Image Composites. To Examine The Spatial Variability Of The Parameters, Certain Transects Were Drawn Over Reflective And Thermal Bands And Then The Spectral Signatures Were Analyzed. Some Changes In The Spectral Behavior Of Water Were Studied By The Selection Of Homogenous Regions Of The Lake From Both Sides Of The Causeway. The Images Were Closely Examined To Follow The Changes Using Image Processing Techniques. The Study Of Spectral Signatures Of The Selected Regions Of Different Times Revealed A Significant Difference Between Two Sides Of The Causeway Having Increased Spatial Variability. Thus, It Can Be Concluded That The Observed Differences Of Two Sections In Understudy Parameters Could Be Attributed To The Blocking Effect Of The Causeway And Inefficiency Of The Gap In Preserving The Link.

It Becomes More Complicated In Endorheic Basins That Consist Of Separate Land And Water Phases. The Application Of Remotely-Sensed Data Is One Solution In This Regard. The Present Study Addresses This Issue And Develops A Modeling Framework To Evaluate A Water Budget Based On Remotely-Sensed Data For Endorheic Basins. To Explore The Methodology, Lake Urmia Basin Was Selected As A Case Study. The Lake Water Level Has Declined Steeply Since 1995 And Stakeholders Have Agreed To Allocate 3100 Mcm Of Water Per Year To The Lake. This Makes It Necessary To Monitor River Inflow Into The Lake To Fulfill The Agreement. Gauging Stations Have Been Employed Around The Lake, But They Could Not Account For Shortages Such As Water Uptake Below The Stations. To Do This, Separate Water Budgets For The Water Body And The Land Were Required. More Specifically, It Was Necessary To Estimate Actual Evapotranspiration (Et A ) From Freshwater (E F ) And Saltwater (E S ) Estimated Using The Sebal Model. Different Methods Were Applied To Estimate Soil Moisture, Groundwater Exploitation, And Surface-Groundwater Inflow Into The Lake. A Comparison Of The Observed And Estimated Amounts Showed Good Agreement. For Instance, The Coefficient Of Determination For The Observed/Reported And Estimated Et A And E F Were 0.83 And 0.84, Respectively. The Average Annual Inflow Was Estimated To Be 2.2 Bcm/Year For 20022008 Using The Rs Model, Which Is About 84% Of The Total Inflow From The Last Recording Stations Before The Lake And Shows Influence Of Water Exploitation After These Stations.

Thus, A New Framework Was Proposed To Develop A Strategic Plan To Stabilize The Shrinking Lake, Based On Sustainable Development Criteria (Sdc). We Developed The Strategies Via The New Hybrid Strategic Sustainable Planning Framework (Sspf), Including A Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat (Swot) Analysis Matrix, Sdc, Multi-Criteria Decision Making Models (Mcdms), And Sensitivity Analysis. First, To Develop Aggressive, Conservative, Competitive, And Defensive Strategies, Sspf Analyzed Site-Specific Internal Strengths And Weaknesses Plus External Opportunities And Threats. It Then, Preliminarily Ranked The Strategies By Embedding Sdc Within Mcdms (Analytic Hierarchy Process [Ahp], Simple Additive Weighting [Saw], And Technique For Order Of Preference By Similarity To Ideal Solution [Topsis]). To Promote Confidence In Selection Of The Strategy, Sensitivity Analyses Of The Results Were Also Performed. Here, The Selected Strategy Had The Highest Rank Among The Set Of Strategies, With The Least Sensitivity To The Input Data Variations. Saw And Ahp Were The Models Least And Most Sensitive To Sdc Weight Variations, Respectively. According To Sustainability Analysis, The Purely Structurally Oriented Strategies Were Determined To Be Environmentally Non-Sustainable. Based On The Results, We Identified 2 Conservative-Competitive Strategies That Could Stabilize The Lake And Prevent Future Losses.

The Approach Of Data Collection As Well As The Amount Of Data And Dispersion Of Data Series Can Last A Significant Impact On Creating Such Joint Probability Distribution Using Copulas. Usually, Such Traditional Analyses Have Shed An Unconnected Drought Runs (Udr) Approach Towards Droughts. In Other Word, Droughts With Different Durations Would Be Independent Of Each Other. Emphasis On Such Data Collection Method Causes The Omission Of Actual Potentials Of Short-Term Extreme Droughts Located Within A Long-Term Udr. Meanwhile, Traditional Method Is Often Faced With Significant Gap In Drought Data Series. However, A Long-Term Udr Can Be Approached As A Combination Of Short-Term Connected Drought Runs (Cdr). Therefore This Study Aims To Evaluate Systematically Two Udr And Cdr Procedures In Joint Probability Of Drought Duration And Severity Investigations.

The Low Levels Of Long-Term Precipitation And High Variability In Different Time Scales Are Considered The Main Inherent Characteristics Of Climate In Iran. Due To The Direct Effects Of Precipitation On Water Resources, Especially On The River Flow Rate, It Is Necessary To Assess The Efficient Indices To Visualize The Variations In The Components Of Water Resources. One Of The Main Indices Is The Precipitation Concentration Index (Pci) Which Is Known As A Strong Indicator Of The Precipitation Distribution Generally Used On Annual And Seasonal Scales. In This Study, Drought Analysis In The Lake Urmia Basin (Lub) Located In Northwest Of Iran Was Performed With The Daily River Flow Rate And Monthly Precipitation Values Within The Period Of 19842013. The Results Of Changes In Precipitation Indicated That The Irregularity Of Precipitation Distribution Had Grown In Spring Months. Also, Due To The Diminishing Precipitation Trend On The Annual Time Scale, Pci Index Also Increased. It Is Concluded That Lub Detected A Significant Descending Trend On The Annual, Spring, And Winter Time Scales In The Last 30 Years. The Pci Values Were Proved High Irregularity In Summer With Pci Amount Of 20.1 And Most Regularity In Winter With Pci Amount Of 10.4.

This Condition Has Threatened Biota Life, Intensified Desertification Around The Lake, And Raised Social Concerns By Adversely Impacting The Inhabitants Health And Economy. In 2013, The Urmia Lake Restoration National Committee (Ulrnc) Started Implementing Certain Management Practices To Stop The Drying Trend Of Lu, Resulted In The Cease Of Water Level Drop And Stabilization Of Lu Condition In 2016. Nevertheless, The Restoration Actions Have Not Yet Raised The Lake To The Water Level As Planned By The Roadmap. This Paper Aims To Describe And To Assess The Lu Restoration Plans By Underscoring The Ulrnc Achievements, Challenges, And Shortcomings. In Particular, We Discuss How The Value Of Data And Data-Aided Modeling Has Been Underestimated By The Lu Restoration Programs, Leading To Still Existing Puzzles About The Lake Interaction With The Involving Physical Processes Governing Its Dynamics. We Show How The Lu Restoration Timetable Has Not Fulfilled The Planned Milestones As Evidenced By The Inability To Capture The Anticipated Lake Water Levels, Which Is Partly Attributed To The Lack Of Field Data And Dynamic Modeling That Could Predict The Lake Response In A More Reliable And Conservative Manner. The Current Restoration Plans Should Also Be Revisited To Ensure That Any Practice With The Aim Of Reducing Water Consumption In The Basin Is Not Only Environmentally Sustainable But Also Feasible From The Socioeconomic Perspective.

Three Gis-Mcda Methods In Conjunction With Monte Carlo Simulation (Mcs) And Dempster-Shafer Theory Are Analyzed For Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (Lsm) In The Urmia Lake Basin In Iran, Which Is Highly Susceptible To Landslide Hazards. The Methodology Comprises Three Stages. First, The Lsm Criteria Are Ranked And A Sensitivity Analysis Is Implemented To Simulate Error Propagation Based On The Mcs. The Resulting Weights Are Expressed Through Probability Density Functions. Accordingly, Within The Second Stage, Three Mcda Methods, Namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (Ahp), Weighted Linear Combination (Wlc) And Ordered Weighted Average (Owa), Are Used To Produce The Landslide Susceptibility Maps. In The Third Stage, Accuracy Assessments Are Carried Out And The Uncertainties Of The Different Results Are Measured. We Compare The Accuracies Of The Three Mcda Methods Based On (1) The Dempster-Shafer Theory And (2) A Validation Of The Results Using An Inventory Of Known Landslides And Their Respective Coverage Based On Object-Based Image Analysis Of Irs-Id Satellite Images.

The Lake Has Lost Almost 88% Of Its Surface Area In Comparison To Its Value In 1995. This Has Left A Bed Of Salt Around The Lake, That Has The Potential To Disperse A Significant Amount Of Aerosols (Dust And Salt) Into The Atmosphere. We Use The Recordings Of The Calipso Satellite To Investigate The Optical Parameters Of Atmospheric Aerosols Over The Urmia Lake. For This Purpose, The Aerosol Optical Depth (Aod) And The Particulate Depolarization Ratio (Pdr) At 532 Nm Have Been Selected From The Whole Available Recordings Of The Calipso. To Distinguish Between The Atmospheric Particles Which Are Originating From The Lake Bed And Those That Are Transported From The Surrounding Sources To The Lake Area, The Pdr Has Been Categorized For Two Altitude Ranges, I.E., From The Ground Level Up To 2 Km Above The Mean Sea Level (Amsl) And Above 3 Km Amsl. Investigating The Variations Of The Pdr At These Two Altitude Ranges, Provides Information About The Type Of Atmospheric Particles At Different Times Of The Year. Although It Is Not Easy To Distinguish Between The Transported Dust Layers And Atmospheric Particles From The Lake Bed, It Seems That The Urmia Lake Is Mostly Active In The Driest Times Of The Year, I.E., June To October.

Typically, This Involves Replacing Presumably Error-Free Laboratory Salinity Measurements With Indirect Measurements That Are However Affected By Various Source Of Uncertainties, And These Uncertainties Need To Be Accounted For In Order To Avoid Compromising The Quality Of The Final Results. More Specifically, In A Spatiotemporal Prediction Framework Where Salinity Maps Need To Be Drawn Repeatedly At Various Time Instants And Where Salinity Values Need To Be Compared Over Time For Agricultural Areas That Are Prone To Salinity Hazards, It Is Of Major Importance To Process These Uncertainties In A Sound Way, As Failing To Do So Would Impair Our Ability To Detect Salinity Changes At An Early Stage For Taking Preventive Actions. The Aim Of This Paper Is To Propose A Filtered Kriging Framework That Allows The User To Rely On Cheap Field Sampled Electrical Conductivity (Ec) Measurements, That Cannot However Be Assumed As Error-Free. Field Ec Measurements Need To Be Calibrated From Laboratory Measurements And The Corresponding Calibration Errors Cannot Be Neglected. Moreover, When Sampling Is Repeated Over Time, Positioning Errors Are Quite Common And Can Adversely Impact The Results Due To The Inclusion Of An Extra Variability Source. It Is Shown How These Uncertainties Can Be Quantified And Successfully Processed Afterwards For Improving Both The Reliability Of The Spatial Predictions And Temporal Comparisons Of Soil Salinity. The Idea Is To Rely On A Same General Optimal Linear Predictor That Can Be Easily Adapted To Get Rid Of These Unwanted Effects. The Procedure Is Illustrated By Using A Rich Data Set Of Ec Measurements That Cover A Time Span Of Seven Years In The Western Part Of Urmia Lake, Northwest Iran. From These Data, It Is Shown How Calibration Errors Can Be Considered As Spatially Independent And Zero-Mean Gaussian Distributed, While Laboratory Measurements Exhibit A Clear Spatial Structure But Are Also Affected By A Not Inconsiderable Spatial Nugget Effect, Which Is In Turn Impacting The Errors For Field Ec Measurements Due To The Positioning Errors. By Relying On A Linear Optimal Predictor That Reduces Here To Filtered Kriging With Measurement Errors, It Is Shown That Filtering Out These Two Random Effect Components Clearly Improves The Quality Of The Results When It Comes To Map Ec Values And To Detect Changes That Occurred Over Time. Comparing Filtered Values For The Successive Sampling Campaigns Provided Evidence That A Major Salinity Shift Did Occur Between Autumn 2011 And Autumn 2014 While The Other Parts Of The Area Were Left Unchanged By Comparison. From This Study, It Can Be Concluded That Even If The Only Errors Involved In This Work Were Linked To Calibration And Positioning Errors, The Methodology Is General Enough To Process Various Sources Of Uncertainties In General. It Is Thus A Valuable Tool For Practitioners, With A Field Of Potential Applications That Goes Beyond The Framework Of Salinity Monitoring. 2017","Electrical Conductivity, Filtered Kriging, Measurement Errors, Soil Salinity, Spatial Prediction, Urmia Lake, Calibration, Electric Conductivity, Electric Conductivity Measurement, Errors, Forecasting, Hazards, Interpolation, Laboratories, Lakes, Measurement Errors, Random Errors, Random Processes, Research Laboratories, Salinity Measurement, Soils, Uncertainty Analysis, Electrical Conductivity, Indirect Measurements, Kriging, Laboratory Measurements, Soil Salinity, Sources Of Uncertainty, Spatial Prediction, Spatio-Temporal Prediction, Soil Surveys, Calibration, Data Set, Electrical Conductivity, Error Analysis, Gaussian Method, Kriging, Laboratory Method, Monitoring System, Salinity, Spatiotemporal Analysis, Uncertainty Analysis, Iran, Lake Urmia",6,10.1016/J.GEODERMA.2017.02.004,22-33,Scopus,295,2017

Article,"Kokya, Ba//Kokya, Ta",Proposing A Formula For Evaporation Measurement From Salt Water Resources,Hydrological Processes,"Evaporation Involves The Change In State Of A Liquid To A Vapour. The Evaporation Rate From Salt-Water Resources Depends Mostly On Saturated Vapour Pressure Above Its Surface. On The Other Hand, The Saturated Vapour Pressure Is Affected By The Ion Activity Coefficient, Which Stems From The Chemical Salt Concentration Of Water. Thus, An Increase In Concentration Of Water Results In A Reduction Of Saturated Vapour Pressure. In Order To Acquire The Actual Rate Of Evaporation From Salt-Water Resources, A Uniform Set Of Evaporation Pans With Different But Specified Salt Concentrations Were Used, In A Meteorological Station Under The Same Conditions. The Difference In Evaporation Rate Of Each Pan Can Only Stem From The Difference In Chemical Salt Concentration And, Indeed, The Molar Fraction Of Water In Each Saline Solution.

Article,"Malekian, A//Kazemzadeh, M",Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Regional Trends And Shift Changes Of Autocorrelated Temperature Series In Urmia Lake Basin,Water Resources Management,"Recently, The Urmia Lake Located In Northwestern Iran Which Is The Second Largest Hyper Saline In The World Suffers From The Significant Fluctuations Of Water Level And Surface Area. The Current Study Tries To Investigate The Spatiotemporal Trends Of Mean (Tmean), Maximum (Tmax) And Minimum (Tmin) Temperatures Of Monthly, Seasonal And Annual Time-Series. To Do So, The Data Of 15 Temperature Gauge Stations Within The Urmia Lake Basin, For The Period 19722011 Was Employed. The Pre-Whitening Approach Was Applied To Remove The Effects Of Serial Correlation In The Air Temperature Series Based On The Mann-Kendall (Mk) Test. The Results Of Ljung-Box Test Showed Positive Serial Correlation In The Tmean And Tmax Series For All Of The Stations At The 0.05 Significance Level. In The Monthly Series, The Significant Warming Trends In The Tmean Series Were More Perceptible Than The Same Ones In Tmax Series, However, Tmax Trend Was Found More Than Tmin Series. The Mannwhitney (Mw) Test Detected A Significance Upward Shift Changes In The Annual Tmean, Tmax And Tmin Series Of About 86, 73 And 80% Of The Stations, Respectively. The Average Magnitude Of Significant Warming Trends In Annual Tmean, Tmax And Tmin Series Were (+) 0.58 C, (+) 0.52 C And (+) 0.69 C Per Decade, Respectively. Furthermore, The Interpolation Maps Showed That Warming Trends In The East And West Of Urmia Lake Were More Than Southern Area. Therefore, The Results Showed That The Basin Has Suffered From Increasing Trends In The Tmean, Tmax And Tmin Over The Recent Decades. Finally, Significant Changes Were Found In 1980S And 1990S Based On The Mann-Kendall Ranks And Change Point Tests.

Article,"Marjani, A//Jamali, M",Role Of Exchange Flow In Salt Water Balance Of Urmia Lake,Dynamics Of Atmospheres And Oceans,"In This Paper We Examine How Exchange Flow In Urmia Lake Plays A Crucial Role In Dynamics Of The Lake. Urmia Lake, A Very Large Hyper-Saline Lake Of High Ecological Significance, Is Located In Northwest Of Iran With A 15-Km Causeway Dividing It Into North And South Lakes. A 1250-M Opening In The Causeway Near The East Coast Links The Two Lakes. The Differences In Mean Water Levels And Densities Of The Two Lakes Increase In Spring Due To Large Freshwater Inflows Into The South Lake. High Evaporation Dominates The Lake In Summer. By Incorporating The Results Of A Two-Layer Hydraulics Theory Into A Mixing Model Of The Lake, We Show That The Exchange Flow Through The Opening Diminishes The Water Level And Salinity Differences Of The Two Lakes And Hence Helps Restoration Of The Pre-Construction State Of The Lake By The End Of Fall. The Model Results Are Confirmed By The Field Data. The North-South And South-North Flows Through The Opening Are Equal In Most Of The Year, Except In Spring When The South-North Flow Is Greater Due To The Head Difference Of The Two Lakes. 2013 Elsevier B.V.","Balance Model, Exchange Flow, Salinity, Urmia Lake, Water Quality, Balance Model, Exchange Flow, Freshwater Inflow, Mean Water Levels, Mixing Models, Model Results, Pre-Construction, Salinity, Bridges, Causeways, Water Levels, Water Quality, Lakes, Evaporation, Hydrology, Hypersaline Environment, Lake Water, Salinity, Water Budget, Water Exchange, Water Quality, Iran, Lake Urmia",9,10.1016/J.DYNATMOCE.2013.10.001,43846,Scopus,65,2014
Article,"Mogaddam, Aa//Gorgij, Ad","Feasibility Study For Hydraulic Connection In Azarshahr Plain Coastal Aquifer And Urmia Lake, By Geochemical Ratios And Inverse Modeling",Journal Of Environmental Studies,"Introduction: Azarshahr Plain Is One Of The Plains Adjacent To The Lake Urmia That Has Been Faced, During Recent Years, With Over Extraction Of Groundwater And Also Exposed To Salinity Enrichment. On The Other Hand, Urmia Lake With About 5000 Square Kilometers Is The Relatively Vast Lake With Hyper-Saline Water As A Rare Biosphere Resource In Iran And The World. This Lake Has A Great Economic, Social And Bio-Spherical Importance In Iran. It Has Faced With Enormous Water Depletion During The Recent Years. Many Studies Has Been Conducted About Climate Change, Drought, Rivers Discharge Declining And Changing In Land Use So Far That Increasing In Water Utilization In Agricultural Activities Have Taken Into Account As The Most Important Factor In Water Table Reduction Of Urmia Lake. However, There Is No Study About The Hydraulic Connection Between Lake And Its Adjacent Aquifers. Perception Of Spatial Changes In Groundwater Components That Is Resulted From Various Inputs Is A Difficult Work, Especially If Chemical Composition Or Boundary Conditions Change Over Time, As It Is Popular In Coastal Aquifers. Utilization Of Geochemistry In Different Water Resources Connection Has Done In Many Studies. Geochemists Generally Seek To Find Chemical Ratios Such As Na + /Cl + , Ca ++ /Mg ++ , Ca ++ /Hco 3 - + So 4 - And Cl - /Hco 3 - + Co 3 - And 18 O And 2 H Isotopes As Saltwater Intrusion Indicators. The Present Study For The First Time Investigates The Hydraulic Connection Between Urmia Lake And Azarshahr Plain Aquifer Using Geochemical Ratios And Geochemical Modeling. Materials And Methods: Urmia Lake Is A Kind Of The Widest And Shallowest Lakes In The World And Has Hyper Saline Water. A Lot Of Permanent And Seasonal River And Streams Feed The Lake. Broad And Unwanted Changes In Water And Ecology Of This Lake Have Been Started About 2 Decade Before And During This Time. The Water Volume Of The Lake Decreased To Less Than 14 Billion M 3 In 2011 From About 32 Billion M 3 In 1995. Azashahr Study Area Is Considered As One Of The Lake Twelve Adjacent Aquifers That Is Located Between 45,46 To 45, 50 Longitudinal And 37,43 To 37,52 Latitudinal. Its Total Area Is About 457 Km 2 That Its Plain Has An Area About 124 Km 2 . The Highest And Lowest Height In The Study Area Is 3700 M And 1282 M, Respectively. Its Average Annual Precipitation Is About 221.2 Mm Whereas The Average Annual Evaporation Is About 1579 Mm. And The Most Important Stream In Azarshahr Plain Is Azarshahrchai. It Has A Southeast-Northwest Trend And Is Eliminated To The Lake Because Of Wide Agricultural Usage. On The Other Hand, The Total Annual Discharge Of The Aquifer Is About 90.64 Million M 3 That Is One Of The Groundwater Depletion And Saltwater Intrusion Factors In The Study Area. Groundwater Salinity Is Increased In Azarshahr Plain Aquifer Because Of Wide Discharge In One Side And Decrease In Urmia Lake Water Level On The Other Hand. This Probably Shows That Saltwater Intrusion To Azarshahr Plain Aquifer Is In Relation With Water Level Decreases In Urmia Lake And Consequently Reveals The Hydraulic Connection Between Them. To Investigate This Connection, Groundwater Sampling And Analysis Were Conducted And Hydraulic Connection Evaluation Was Done Via Three Steps As Below. Graphical Methods: Three Popular Piper, Stiff And Pie Chart Graphical Method Was Selected And The Samples Were Plotted After The Analysis And Were Compared To Urmia Lake Water Samples. Star Diagram Also Was Plotted For The Samples And Their Map Was Drawn. On The Other Hand, Pie Chart That Shows The Percentage Of Water Major Components Was Calculated And Their Distribution In Study Area Was Plotted And Compared To Urmia Water Component Percentage. Geochemical Ratios: General Status Of Saline Water Is Ci - And Na + Dominance With 0.86 Molar Ratio And Of Course Ci - Exceed Over The Alkali Metals (Na + And K + ). Also, Mg ++ Is More Than Ca ++ Absolutely (I.E. Mg ++ /Ca ++ =4.5-5). On The Other Hand, Continental Fresh Water Is Known With Its Variable Composition And Its Dominant Anions Are, Hco - 3 , So 4 - And Ci - . Geochemists Try To Find Also The Below Geochemical Ratios Generally For Saltwater Intrusion Resource Determination: Na + /Cl - , Ca ++ /Mg ++ , Ca ++ /Hco 3 - + So 4 - And Ci - /Hco 3 - + Co 3 - And Also Some Isotopes Such As Boron, Oxygen And Hydrogen. In The Present Study, Geochemical Ratios Were Calculated And Plotted In Study Area For Saltwater Intrusion Resource Finding And Also Evaluation Of Hydraulic Connection Between Urmia Lake And Azarshahr Plain Aquifer. Geochemical Inverse Modeling: Hydro-Geochemical Modeling Is An Important Tool For Recognition Of Geochemical Reactions In Groundwater. In The Modeling Process, Geochemical Reactions During The Flow Path Such As Solution, Precipitation, Mixing And Cation Exchange Are Simulated And Compared With Final Water Composition. Solute Aggregation In Groundwater Can Be Supposed As A Reaction Of Water With Surrounding Minerals In Porous Media. Hydro-Geologists Utilize The Water Chemical Data For Classification Of Various Mineral Balance Situations. In This Study, Ion Activity Product (Iap) And Balance Constant (K) And Also Saturation Index (Si) Were Used For Probable Minerals, Composition Creation And Comparison With Probable Phases In Urmia Lake Water Sample. Therefore, Because Of Enormous Volume Of Calculations In Balance Reactions And Also Finding The Balance Constant For Reactions, Phreeqc Computer Code Has Been Used And Probable Phases In Groundwater Mixed Samples And Urmia Lake Water Sample Were Created And Compared To Each Other. These Were Carried Out To Find If There Is Any Chemical Connection Between Lake And Azarshahr Aquifer. The Mixed Samples Were Created In Three Paths Near The Lake. Mixing Reaction Was Done Between Samples Number 18 And 19, 20 And 23 And Also Between 25 And 22 In Porous Media Presentation. Results And Discussion: Geochemical Analysis Results Of Groundwater Samples And Urmia Lake Indicated That Dominant Cation In Azarshar Aquifer And Urmia Lake Are Ca ++ And Na + , Respectively. Also Groundwater Dominant Anions Are Hco 3 - , So 4 - And Ci - During The Flow Direction, Whereas Dominant Anion In Lake Water Is Ci"" That Is Distinct Characteristic Of Marine Composition. Piper Diagram Revealed That Groundwater Type In Study Area Are Ca ++ - Na + - Hco 3 - And Ca ++ -Na + -Cl - Whereas Urmia Lake Water Is In Na + -Cl - Type. The Nearest Sample To Urmia Lake Water Composition Is Sample Number 7 That Is Located Out Of Aquifer Domain And Is Affected By Anthropogenic Activities Probably. Also Stiff Diagram Of Groundwater Samples And Urmia Lake Aren'T Similar To Each Other And Show The Different Sources. Na + /Cl - Ratio In Saltwater Intrusion Is Lower Than Marine Values (I.E. Molar Ratio&Lt,0.86). On The Other Hand, Ratio More Than 1 Is The Indicator Of Anthropogenic Activities Such As Residential Area Wastewater. Na + /Cl - Ratio Distribution In The Aquifer Domain Shows That In The Northwest And West Of Aquifer, There Is Na + /Cl - Ratio Less Than Marine Ratio. Therefore, There Is Saltwater Intrusion From Northwest Of The Study Area. Also Evaluation Of Ca ++ /(Hco 3 - + So 4 - ) And Ca ++ /Mg ++ Ratios Revealed That, These Ratios In Aquifer Domain Are More Than Those In Urmia Lake Water Spectacularly. As It Can Be Clearly Seen, Minimum Value For Ca ++ /Mg ++ Ratio In Aquifer Domain Starts From About 29 And For Ca ++ /(Hco 3 - + So 4 - ) Ratio Starts From About 0.2, Whereas These Ratios Are 0.01 And 0.03 For Urmia Lake, Respectively. This Shows No Relation Between Aquifer Groundwater And Urmia Lake. Other Popular Geochemical Ratio For Saltwater Intrusion Is Reveile Ratio Explained As [Cl - /(Hco 3 - + Co 3 - )]. Ratio More Than 1.5 Depicts The Saltwater Intrusion. Reveile Distribution Plot Represented That There Is Saltwater Intrusion From Domain Northwest Direction But It Is Not From The Lake Because Of Its Direction And Also South-North Trend. Hydro-Geochemical Modeling Of Different Groundwater Sample Mixing In Flow Direction And The Nearest Distance To The Lake Has Been Indicated As A Comparsion Between Probable Phases Saturation Index. The Results Show That Mixing Of Samples Had Been Done But Probable Phases Did Not, Same As The Probable Phases In Urmia Lake Water. Conclusion: Saltwater Intrusion From Urmia Lake To Adjacent Aquifers Because Of Their Heavy Pumping Rate Is One Of Probable Factors In Water Level Depletion Of Urmia Lake. On The Other Hand, Finding The Relationship Between Different Types Of Water Resources To Each Other By Geochemistry Is A Popular Way That Have Not Been Done So Far In Urmia Lake. Therefore, Use Of Geochemistry Studies And Its Different Branches Were The Base Of This Study. At Last, After The Use Of Geochemical Ratios And Geochemistry Modeling, Their Results Indicated That There Is Saltwater Intrusion In Azarshahr Plain Aquifer, But It Is Not From Urmia Lake Water. Probably It Comes From Adjacent Salty Pans To The Aquifer.","Azarshahr, Geochemical Inverse Modelling, Hydraulic Connection, Saltwater Intrusion, Urmia Lake, Na",0,NA,13-15,Scopus,42,2016

Article,"Safaee, A//Mohammadi, Bm",Game Theoretic Insights For Sustainable Common Poll Water Resources Governance (Case Study: Lake Urmia Water Conflict),Journal Of Environmental Studies,"Introduction: Common Pool Water Resources (Cpwrs) Face Overuse And Congestion Due To Increased Competition For The Non-Excludability And Subtractability Nature Of Their Use. In The Cpwrs Conflicts, Beneficiaries Base Their Actions On Individual Rationality Which Negatively Affect All Users Eventually Due To The Lack Of Trust Between Them, Their Self-Optimizing Tendencies, And Inadequate Information About The Consequences Of Their Actions. Game Theory Provides A Formal Mathematical Framework To Strategic Analysis Of Such Conflict And To Able Presenting Some Institutions To Prevent Tragedy Of Commons. Lake Urmia Is The Most Valuable Ecosystem Located In The Same Name Basin In Iran In The Recent Years, The Basin'S Upstream Water Resources Faced To Overuse Due To An Increase In The Attitudes Of Parties To Gain More Economic Benefits From Agriculture Activities Which Led To Conflicts As Well As Threats To Lake Urmia'S Life. The Literatures Which Studied This Environmental Crisis Are Limited With Respect To Understanding Strategic Interactions Between The Actors And How Such Interactions May Affect The Results Of The Lake Urmia Water Conflict. Materials And Methods: In Order To Study The Lake Urmia Water Conflict, Basic Information Were Prepared Through A Review Of The Relative Literatures, The Technical Documents, And The News Reports. These Collected Data Were Completed By Referring To Experts Opinions And Finally The Conflict Was Modeled And Analyzed Based On The Gmcr Process Of Resolving Conflicts. As A Non-Cooperative Game Theoretical Model, The Graph Model For Conflict Resolution (Gmcr) Was Developed Through A Combination Of Extensive Form Of Conflict Analysis And Graph Theory. Figure 1 Outlines The Gmcr Process Of Resolving Conflicts Which Involves Two Main Stages Including Modeling And Analyzing. The Modeling Stage Includes Defining Decision Makers And Their Options, Removing Infeasible States Of The Conflict, Specifying Allowable Transitions From Each State For Each Player, And Finally Defining The Relative Preferences Of Each Player Over Each State. In The Analyzing Stage, Stability Of The Feasible States For Each Player Is First Analyzed Using The Formal Mathematical Definitions Named Non-Cooperative Solution Concepts. The Second Stage Is Followed By Finding The Equilibria Or Likely Outcomes Of The Conflict (States Which Are Stable For All Stakeholders Under A Given Solution Concept). If A Given State Is Known As Equilibrium Under A Range Of Solution Concepts, Then It Is A Strong Equilibrium With A Higher Likelihood Of Being The Final Outcome Of The Game. After That, Some Alternative Scenarios Are Defined In Order To Examine The Sensitivity Of The Results To Changing Input Information. Finally, Strategic Insights From Decision Makers' Interactions Are Presented To Help Them For Better Decision Making. Discussion: Of Results And Conclusions: As Can Be Seen In Table 1, There Were Five Decision Makers With Seven Options In The Lake Urmia Water Conflict. The Number Of Total States Of The Conflict Was 128 Which Reduced To 72 After Infeasible States Were Removed. Then, Allowable Moves From A Given State To Each Other And The Player'S Preferences Were Defined Respectively. Based On The Dm'S Preferences, The Ministry Of Agri-Jihad (Maj) Has Preferred To Continue Its New Agriculture Development Projects While It Has Tended To Protect The Basin'S Farmers To Improve Their Cultivation And Irrigation Styles. Although The Ministry Of Energy (Moe) Has Interested To Implement Interbasin Water Transformation Projects But It Has Not Liked To Stop Its New Water Resources Development Plans. The Basin'S Provinces (Bp) Have Disagreed To Stop Their New Local Water And Agricultural Development Plans. Farmers Of The Basin (F) Have Liked To Continue Their Illegal Overuse From Upstream Water Resources Of The Basin And The Central Government (Cg) Has Preferred To Take No Action To Force Maj, Moe, And Bp To Stop Their New Development Plans. After The Conflict Was Modeled, The Stability Analysis Was Applied Through Non-Cooperative Solution Concepts Followed By An Alternative Preference Scenario Developed In Order To Find How Changes In Decision Makers' Preferences Affect The Initial Results. According To Table 2, Eight Outcomes Became Known As The Game Equilibria. The Results Indicated That The State 6, Which Is Current Situation Of The Real World Conflict As Well As Selected As Status Quo Of The Analysis, Was Suggested As The Most Likely Outcome Of The Game In The Initial Analysis By Gmcr. It Means That Lake Urmia Crisis Mainly Rooted In Individual Rationality Based Behaviors Of Beneficiaries Which Appeared As They Persisted On Increasing Their Shares From Common Poll Resources Of The Basin Upstream. Also, It Proposed Gmcr As An Effective And Applicable Tool For Strategic Analysis And Sustainable Common Poll Water Resources Governance. Based On The Results Of Sensitivity Analysis To Move Out The Status Quo, The Central Government Should Change His Initial Preferences Through Strong Interference In The Conflict And Force The Parties To Stop Their Upstream New Developments. If Such Situation Occurs, The State 68 Will Be Chosen As The Final Resolution Of This Conflict.","Common Poll Water Resources, Game Theory, Graph Model For Conflict Resolution, Lake Urmia, Sustainable Governance, Na",1,NA,121-138,Scopus,40,2014

The Data Base Used In This Research Was Gpcc For Precipitation And Ncep/Ncar For Temperature. This Study Aims Not Only To Evaluate The Performance Of Rdi And Spi, But Also To Find Out The Reason Of Urmia Lake Drying Up As Second Largest Hyper Saline Lake In The World. According To The Results, Urmia Lake Basin Faced The Most Severe Drought Condition In The Past Half Century In 19982000, And Afterwards It Could Not Enter Into A Suitable Wet State During The Later Years. Although It Was Found That Both Spi And Rdi Performance In Drought Recognition Was Acceptable And Matched In Many Cases, Nevertheless, It Was Concluded That Rdi Is More Sensitive To Severe Drought. While Spi Had No Long Term Trend, Rdi Showed Negative Trend And An Abrupt Change In Around 1996 Which Could Be Addressed As A Consequence Of Global Warming. These Characteristics Gave A Better Perspective Of Drought Phenomenon Across The Basin And Introduced Rdi As A Conservative And Reliable Tool For Studying Drought In The Urmia Lake Basin.

Most Of The Studies On Lake Urmia Have Neglected The Groundwater Issue. In This Study, As A Direct Approach, The Interaction Between The Groundwater Level And The Lake Water Level Is Investigated Both In Time And Space By Analysing The Groundwater Data Compiled From Observation Wells Surrounding The Lake. Baseflow Separation Is Considered As An Indirect Approach To Understand The Groundwater Contribution To The River Network Flowing Into The Lake. It Is Determined That About 70% Of Run-Off In The Rivers Draining Into The Lake Is Born In The Form Of Baseflow. An Interaction Between The Lake And The Groundwater Storage Is Clearly Seen From The Analysis To Conclude That Groundwater Has A Potential To Recharge The Lake.

Evaporation From The Surface Of The Lake, As A Physical Process Which Accelerates The Lakes Degradation, Was Evaluated Using Chaos Theory. Seven Hydrometeorological Stations Scattered Around The Lake Were Selected, And A 40-Year Time Span Between October 1974 And September 2014 Was Used At Each Station. Missing Data In Time Series Was Removed And The Whole Time Series Was Tested For Consistency, Randomness, And Presence Of Trend. Since Evaporation At Each Station Was Measured By Means Of Class A Evaporation Pan, Time Series At Each Station Was Multiplied By A Pan Coefficient To Incorporate The Effect Of Saline Water And Free Water Surface Environment Simultaneously. Measurement Errors Arising From Assumption Of Zero Evaporation In Winter Were Removed From The Time Series Using Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing Method After Which Unification Of Time Series Into A Single Time Series Is Achieved. Results Of The Data Transformation And Information Loss Were Monitored By Means Of Auto-Correlation, Partial-Auto-Correlation, Mutual Information, Power Spectrum, False Nearest Neighbor, And Correlation Dimension. A Local Prediction Method Is Then Used To Capture The Temporal Dynamics Of The Evaporation With Consideration Of An Appropriate Time Delay And Embedding Dimension. Finally, The Representative Model Was Projected On A 3-Dimensional Phase Space To Evaluate The Temporal Dynamics Of The Evaporation.

In Recent Decades The Imprudent Industrial Development Accompanied By Continuous Use Of Groundwater Aquifers Has Been One Of The Most Pivotal Reasons For This Crisis. Water Level Monitoring And Detection Of Its Changes Within Urmia Lake As Well As The Surrounding Environment In The Past 60 Years Integrating Gis, Remote Sensing And Photogrammetric Methods Is The Main Goal For This Study. In Order To Accomplish This, Aerial Photogrammetry Images And Derived Topographic Maps From Them For The Year 1955, Digital Elevation Data, Quantitative And Qualitative Information Regarding Water Wells And Lake Urmia Respectively And Finally Remotely Sensed Images Of Landsat Tm, Etm+ And Oli Sensors Were Used. The Temporal Range For The Study Was Set To 60 From The Year 1955 To 2014. Scrutinizing 12 Images Relating To Different Periods, Vast Changes In Both Area And Perimeter Of The Lake Were Detected. Based On The Results, The Lake Area Has Decreased From 451800 Hectares In 1955 To 89730 In Recent Years Due To Various Causative Factors. It Is Also Found That The Highest Water Recession, Which Caused Increasing Coastal Salty Areas, Has Been Occurred In The Southern Parts Of The Lake. While The Receding Water Level Of The Lake Has A Deep Correlation With The Increasing Agricultural Activities Around The Lake, It Has A Reverse Relation With The Lake Water Ec. These Fluctuations Can Be Detrimental To The Environment, Economy And Society. Looking At The Changes In Lake Urmia, If The Current Situation Keeps On And No Drastic Measures Are Taken, Turning Into A Salt Land, The Lake Would Be Completely Disappeared Till 2033. Authors 2018.

Article,"Yasi, M//Ashori, M",Environmental Flow Contributions From In-Basin Rivers And Dams For Saving Urmia Lake,Iranian Journal Of Science And Technology - Transactions Of Civil Engineering,"Dramatic Shrinkage Of The Internationally Registered Urmia Lake, Iran, Is Mainly Related To The Reduction In Rivers Flowing Into The Lake. This Flow Reduction Is Due To Irrigation Of Agricultural Lands Upstream Of The Lake. The Potential Flows Into The Lake Are Greatly Influenced By Ten Perennial Rivers, Hosting 24 Large Dams. Among These Is The Zarine River, The Largest, Which Contributes To 41 % Of Surface Water Flows Into The Lake. The River Flows Are Controlled By The Bukan Dam, The Largest Reservoir In The Lake Basin. The Riverine Lives In The Basin Are Increasingly Degraded, And The Recipient Lake Is Drying Up. Allocation Of Environmental Water Requirements Is Of Main Priorities For Restoration Of The Lake. The Ecological Needs Of The River Were Investigated In Three Different Reaches, Upstream And Downstream Of The Bukan Dam. This Paper Presents A Framework To Address The Evaluation Of Minimum Environmental Flows In This River System From Nine Eco-Hydro Methods. The Overall Results Indicate That 17 To 35 % Of Mean Annual Flow (Maf) Should Be Allocated For Maintaining An Acceptable Minimum Environmental Requirement For Saving The Urmia Lake. The Allocated Environmental Flow Releases From The Bukan Dam Is To Be Increased From Currently 9 To 35 % Of Maf. The Contribution From Major Rivers Surroundings The Urmia Lake Is Also Presented.

Review,"Castelluccia, M",Iron Age Fortresses In Transcaucasia,Rossijskaja Arheologija,"The Territory Between The Upper Reaches Of The Euphrates, The Taurus Mountains And Lake Urmia, Which, Starting From The 9Th Century Bc, Saw The Emergence Of The Urartian Kingdom, Is Indeed A Mosaic Of Regional Powers. New Investigations And Research Methods Have Significantly Added A New Perspective Of Our Knowledge Of The Cultural Landscape Of Ancient Transcaucasia. One Of The Most Important Links That Connects The Urartian Period To Earlier Ones Is Fortresses. Towards The End Of The Late Bronze Age (15Th 13Th Cc. Bce) In The Armenian Highland And In Adjoining Regions The Structure Of Society Was Rapidly Becoming More Complex, With The Military Component Gaining Crucial Importance. So-Called Cyclopean Fortresses Begin To Appear In Strategically Important Places, Usually On Elevations And Rocky Mountain Slopes. The Criteria For Creating A Topology Of The Fortified Settlements Are The Perimeter Of The Walls And The Purpose Of The Edifice (Biscione, 2002). On The Basis Of These Parameters Cyclopean Fortified Settlements Can Be Divided Into Three Main Types: Watchtowers, Forts And Fortresses Proper. The Strategic Role Of These Structures Could Have Been Active (Control Over Economic Resources) Or Passive (Place Of Refuge). Even Though We Have Testimony Of A Well-Developed Network Of Fortified Settlements, It Is Often Impossible To Identify, For Instance, The Centers From Which Subordinate Fortresses Could Have Been Controlled. The Gradual Militarization Of Society, As Reflected In The Creation Of A Network Of Fortresses, Is Also Illustrated By Other Types Of Archaeological Data. This Process Of Militarization Was Connected With The Peculiar Evolution Of The Cultures Of The Highlands. 2018 Izdatel'Stvo Nauka.

Article,"Nouri, Gheidari, Mh",Comparisons Of The L- And Lh-Moments In The Selection Of The Best Distribution For Regional Flood Frequency Analysis In Lake Urmia Basin,Civil Engineering And Environmental Systems,"Design Flood Estimation Is An Important Task That Is Required In The Planning And Design Of Many Civil Engineering Projects. Finding The Most Suitable Distribution To Flood Samples And Selecting The Appropriate Parameter Estimation Method Are Of Great Importance For Flood Frequency Analysis. In This Study, L-Moments And Lh-Moments Have Been Used To Characterise The Upper Part Of Distributions And Larger Events In Flood Data. Three Extreme Value Distributions, That Is, Generalised Extreme Value (Gev), Generalised Logistic (Glo) And Generalised Pareto (Gpa), Through Different Levels Of The Lh-Moments Have Been Applied To Describe The Annual Maximum Flood Data Obtained From 34 Sites In Lake Urmia Basin, Northwest Iran. The Performances Of These Distributions Have Been Assessed By Evaluating The Relative Root-Mean-Square Error And The Minimum L-Kurtosis Difference Criterion. The Result Shows That The Lh-Moments Are More Efficient For Obtaining Improved Values Of Flood Peaks Than The L-Moments. For The Upper Part Of Distributions, The Gev Distribution Using The L2-Moment Is The Best, Followed By The Glo Distribution Using The L1-Moment And The Gpa Distribution Using The L3-Moment. The Glo Distribution Using The L-Moments Methods Is The Best Among All Distributions For A Complete Data Series. 2013 Copyright Taylor And Francis Group, Llc.","Flood Frequency Analysis, L-Moments, Lake Urmia Basin, Lh-Moments, Annual Maxima, Civil Engineering Projects, Data Series, Design Flood Estimation, Extreme Value, Extreme Value Distributions, Flood Frequency Analysis, Flood Peak, Gev Distributions, L-Moments, Lake Urmia, Lh-Moments, Parameter Estimation Method, Planning And Design, Regional Flood Frequency Analysis, Root-Mean Square Errors, Civil Engineering, Flood Control, Lakes, Parameter Estimation, Floods, Design, Error Analysis, Estimation Method, Flood Control, Flood Frequency, Iran, Lake Urmia",2,10.1080/10286608.2012.749870,72-84,Scopus,30,2013

Review,"Rodriguez, Merchan, Ec",Topical Therapies For Knee Osteoarthritis,Postgraduate Medicine,"Background: Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis (Oa) Involves Millions Of Adults Around The World. Purpose: To Analyze The Effectiveness And Tolerability Of Topical Therapies And Their Contemporary Placement In Knee Oa Management Criteria. Methods: A Cochrane Library And Pubmed (Medline) Search Related To The Role Of Topical Therapies In Knee Oa Was Carried Out. Results: Many Types Of Local Therapy Have Been Reported, Including Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (Nsaids) Like Diclofenac And Ketoprofen, Capsaicin, Cream Containing Glucosamine Sulfate, Chondroitin Sulfate, And Camphor, Nimesulide, Civamide Cream 0.075%, Menthol, Drug-Free Gel Containing Ultra-Deformable Phospholipid Vesicles (Tdt 064), 4Jointz Utilizing Acteev Technology, Herbal Therapies, Gel Of Medical Leech (Hirudo Medicinalis) Saliva Extract, And Gel Prepared Using Lake Urmia Mud. One Systematic Review Showed That Topical Diclofenac And Topical Ketoprofen Can Alleviate Pain. However, Another Systematic Review Found That Topical Diclofenac And Ketoprofen Had Limited Efficacy In Knee Oa At 6 To 12Weeks. Many Studies With A Low Level Of Evidence Have Reported Some Pain Mitigation Using The Rest Of Aforementioned Topical Therapies. Conclusions: Although Some Controversy Exists On The Role Of Topical Nsaids, Current Management Guidelines Advise Topical Nsaids As An Option And Even First-Line Therapy For Knee Oa Treatment, Particularly Among Elderly Patients. Topical Nsaids May Be Contemplated As Similar Options To Oral Nsaids And Are Associated With Fewer Gastrointestinal Complications When Compared With Oral Nsaids. Caution Should Be Taken With The Use Of Both Topical And Oral Nsaids, Including Close Adherence To Dosing Regimens And Monitoring, Especially For Patients With Previous Complications Of Nsaids.
