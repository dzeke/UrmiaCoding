Our Findings Show That Increasing Water Withdrawal In Iran, Due To Population Growth And Increased Agricultural Activities, Has Been The Main Source Of Historical Water Stress. Increased Levels Of Water Stress Across Iran Are Expected To Continue Or Even Worsen Over The Next Decades Due To Projected Variability And Change In Precipitation Combined With Heightened Water Withdrawals Due To Increasing Population And Socio-Economic Activities. The Greatest Rate Of Decreased Water Storage Is Expected In The Urmia Basin, Northwest Of Iran, (Varying From ~ 8.3Mm/Year In 20102039 To ~ 61.6Mm/Year In 20702099 Compared With An Observed Rate Of 4Mm/Year In 19762005). Human Activities, However, Strongly Dominate The Effects Of Precipitation Variability And Change. Major Shifts Toward Sustainable Land And Water Management Are Needed To Reduce The Impacts Of Water Scarcity In The Future, Particularly In Irans Heavily Stressed Basins Like Urmia Basin, Which Feeds The Shrinking Lake Urmia. 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

The Overarching Goal Of This Paper Is To Set A Framework For Deriving Dynamic, Climate-Informed Environmental Inflows For Drying Lakes Considering Both Meteorological/Climatic And Anthropogenic Conditions. We Report On The Compounding Effects Of Meteorological Drought And Unsustainable Water Resource Management That Contributed To Lake Urmia'S Contemporary Environmental Catastrophe. Using Rich Datasets Of Hydrologic Attributes, Water Demands And Withdrawals, As Well As Water Management Infrastructure (I.E. Reservoir Capacity And Operating Policies), We Provide A Quantitative Assessment Of The Basin'S Water Resources, Demonstrating That Lake Urmia Reached A Tipping Point In The Early 2000S. The Lake Level Failed To Rebound To Its Designated Ecological Threshold (1274 M Above Sea Level) During A Relatively Normal Hydro-Period Immediately After The Drought Of Record (1998-2002). The Collapse Was Caused By A Marked Overshoot Of The Basin'S Hydrologic Capacity Due To Growing Anthropogenic Drought In The Face Of Extreme Climatological Stressors. We Offer A Dynamic Environmental Inflow Plan For Different Climate Conditions (Dry, Wet And Near Normal), Combined With Three Representative Water Withdrawal Scenarios. Assuming Effective Implementation Of The Proposed 40% Reduction In The Current Water Withdrawals, The Required Environmental Inflows Range From 2900 Million Cubic Meters Per Year (Mcm Yr1) During Dry Conditions To 5400 Mcm Yr1 During Wet Periods With The Average Being 4100 Mcm Yr1. Finally, For Different Environmental Inflow Scenarios, We Estimate The Expected Recovery Time For Re-Establishing The Ecological Level Of Lake Urmia. 2018 The Author(S).

Its Upper Miocene And ?Pliocene Basin Fill, Termed Lignite Beds And Fish Beds, Can Provide Detailed Insights Into The Neogene Environments And Processes During A Time Of Intense Tectonics And Volcanism. However, A Modern Re-Evaluation Of The Lignite Beds And Fish Beds Is Lacking. Here We Present Fission Track (Ft) Data From The Northern Hinterland Of The Tabriz Basin (Upper Red Formation) And From The Fish Beds, Which Support Previous Age Assumptions For The Upper Red Formation, But, Together With The New Biostratigraphic Data, Point To An Older Stratigraphic Age For The Lignite And Fish Beds Than Previously Thought (Lignite Beds: 11.6-10.0. Ma, Fish Beds: 10.0-7.5. Ma). Furthermore, We Describe For The First Time The Fossil Fish And Ostracod Fauna And The Diatom Assemblages From Both The Lignite Beds And Fish Beds. All Fossil Groups Are Characterized By The Occurrence Of Freshwater And Brackish Forms, Additional Marine-Euryhaline Taxa Appear Among The Fishes And Diatoms. It Can Be Assumed That The Lignite And Fish Beds Represent Deposits Of A Lacustrine To Euryhaline Late Miocene Lake Urmia During The Initial State Of The Tabriz Basin Subsidence, And That The Ancient Lake Was Located Farther To The East And In A Higher Altitude Than The Present-Day Lake Urmia. The Fossil Assemblages Indicate A New Palaeogeography For The Late Miocene Of The Study Area, With Temporary Connections Between The Tabriz Basin And The Southern Caspian Sea, Perhaps Via An Ancient Araks River Passage. 2011 Elsevier B.V.

During Both Penultimate And Last Glaciations, A Steppe Of Artemisia And Poaceae Dominated The Upland Vegetation With A High Proportion Of Chenopodiaceae In Both Upland And Lowland Saline Ecosystems. While Juniperus And Deciduous Quercus Trees Were Extremely Rare And Restricted To Some Refugia, Hippopha Rhamnoides Constituted An Important Phanerophyte, Particularly During The Late Last Glacial Period. A Pronounced Expansion In Ephedra Shrub-Steppe Occurred At The End Of The Penultimate Late-Glacial Period But Was Followed By Extreme Aridity That Favoured An Artemisia Steppe. Very High Lake Levels, Registered By Both Pollen And Sedimentary Markers, Occurred During The Middle Of The Last Glaciation And Late Part Of The Penultimate Glaciation. The Late-Glacial To Early Holocene Transition Is Represented By A Succession Of Hippopha, Ephedra, Betula, Pistacia And Finally Juniperus And Quercus. The Last Interglacial Period (Eemian), Slightly Warmer And Moister Than The Holocene, Was Followed By Two Interstadial Phases Similar In Pattern To Those Recorded In The Marine Isotope Record And Southern European Pollen Sequences. 2008 University Of Washington.

This Study Examines Daily Aerosol Optical Depth (Aod) Data From The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (Modis) Between 2001 And 2015 Over Northwestern Iran, Which Encompasses Lu. Intriguingly, Salt Emissions From The Lu Surface Associated With Ongoing Desiccation Do Not Drive The Study Region'S Aod Profile, Whereas Pollution Transported From Other Regions And Emissions Around Lu Are More Important. Signatures Of Increasing Local Crustal Emissions Are Most Evident Outside Of The Peak Dust Season (January, February, And October) And On The Periphery Of Lu. Aod Has Generally Increased In The Latter Half Of The Study Period With The Onset Of The Aod Ramp-Up Starting A Month Earlier In The Spring Season When Comparing 20092015 Versus Earlier Years. Results Indicate That Suppression Of Emissions On The Lu Border Is Critical As The Combined Area Of Salt And Salty Soil Bodies Around Lu Have Increased By Two Orders Of Magnitude In The Past Two Decades, And Disturbing These Areas Via Activities Such As Grazing And Salt Harvesting On The Lake Surface Can Have More Detrimental Impacts On Regional Pollution As Compared To Benefits. These Results Have Important Implications For Public Health, Climate, The Hydrological Cycle, And Pollution Control Efforts. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

With A New Composite Of Multi-Spectral High Resolution Satellite Observations, We Show That The Area Of This Iranian Lake Has Decreased By Around 88% In The Past Decades, Far More Than Previously Reported (~ 25% To 50%). The Lake'S Shoreline Has Been Receding Severely With No Sign Of Recovery, Which Has Been Partly Blamed On Prolonged Droughts. We Use The Lake Basin'S Satellite-Based Gauge-Adjusted Climate Record Of The Standardized Precipitation Index Data To Demonstrate That The On-Going Shoreline Retreat Is Not Solely An Artifact Of Prolonged Droughts Alone. Drastic Changes To Lake Health Are Primarily Consequences Of Aggressive Regional Water Resources Development Plans, Intensive Agricultural Activities, Anthropogenic Changes To The System, And Upstream Competition Over Water. This Commentary Is A Call For Action To Both Develop Sustainable Restoration Ideas And To Put New Visions And Strategies Into Practice Before Lake Urmia Falls Victim To The Aral Sea Syndrome. 2014 International Association For Great Lakes Research.

Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems	Lipid Biomarkers Were Analyzed In Lake Van Sediments Covering The Last 600 Ka, With A Focus On The Period Between 110 And 10 Ka, When A Broad Maximum In Pore Water Salinity As A Relict From The Past Suggests Dry Conditions. The Occurrence And Distribution Of Biomarkers Indicative For Terrestrial Plants (Long-Chain N-Alkane C29), Haptophyte Algae (Methyl Alkenones C37) And Halophilic Archaea (Archaeol) All Point Toward A Dry Climate In Lake Van Region During This Time Interval. The Hydrogen Isotopic Composition Of C29 N-Alkanes (Dc29) And C37 Alkenones (Dc37) Is Enriched Between Mis 4 And Mis 2, Which Is Interpreted As A Decrease In The Regional Ratio Of Precipitation To Evaporation. Similarly, The Low Abundance Of The Acyclic Glycerol Dialkyl Glycerol Tetraether Gdgt-0 Relative To Archaeol, Quantified By The Archaeol And Caldarchaeol Ecometric (Ace) Is Assumed To Reflect The Presence Of Halophilic Euryarchaeota Adapted To High Salinity Water. The Climate Around Lake Van Appears In Phase With The Yammouneh Basin 800 Km Southwest And Lake Urmia 250 Km Southeast Of Lake Van Over The Last Two Glacial Periods. The Results Highlight The Potential Of Combining Ace, Dc29, And Dc37 For Reconstructing Salinity Changes And Regional Precipitation To Evaporation Ratio From Lake Sediments. 2017.

Therefore, This Is The First Record Of A. Urmiana In Europe Which Updates Its Distribution. The Species Identification Was Based On An Integrated And Interdisciplinary Approach Using Discriminant Analysis Of The Morphometric Characters, Scanning Electron Microscopy, And Molecular Profile Analysis. The Data Derived From The Above Mentioned Approaches Converge To Significant Similarity Of The Population Under Investigation With A. Urmiana. The Updated Geographic Distribution Of The Species, Deriving From The Present Report, Asks For Additional Contribution Of Other Disciplines (E.G., Avian Dispersal Of Cysts, History Of Salt Trade) To Be Finally Clarified. At Present We Suggest That The Punctuated Geographic Distribution Of A. Urmiana Is Probably Linked To Its Low Dispersal Capability, And We Suppose That Its Presence In Two Distant Sites Could Be Explained By Historical Human Salt Trade Between Lake Urmia And The Ancient Port Of Kimmerik, Whose Remains Have Been Found In The Present Lake Koyashskoe. 2009 Wiley-Vch Verlag Gmbh & Co.

(Asteraceae) Persistence Through The Last Two Glacial-Interglacial Cycles In The Continental Middle East For The Irano-Turanian Flora	Review Of Palaeobotany And Palynology	This Study Explores The Response Of The Irano-Turanian Flora To Quaternary Glacial-Interglacial Cycles In Sw Asia. We Use New Fossil Pollen Data To Assess Variation In Abundance Of Cousinia Cass. (Compositae), A Large Genus Typical For The Irano-Turanian Flora, During These Cycles. The Results Are Compared With Modern Topography, Tectonic And Palaeoclimatic History, And Recent Phylogenetic Data To Explain The Extremely High Speciation Rate And Level Of Endemism As Well As The Modern Geographical Distribution Of The Genus. Cousinia Is Consistently Well-Represented In Glacial-Age And Late-Glacial Pollen Assemblages Of Nw Iran And E Anatolia. In The ~. 200,000-Year Pollen Sequence From Lake Urmia, Nw Iran, Cousinia Pollen Shows Significant Values And Is Nearly Continuously Represented During Both The Last Glacial (~ 70. Ka To Holocene) And Penultimate Glacial Periods (~. 190 To 130. Ka). In Contrast, Its Pollen Is Less Frequent And Occurs Only Sporadically During The Last Interglacial Period And The Holocene. This Pattern Suggests That Cousinia Could Not Only Withstand Quaternary Glaciations, But Was A Significant Part Of The Glacial-Age Landscapes Of The Irano-Turanian Territory. We Argue That The Extremely High Rate Of Speciation And Endemism Of Cousinia Is Due To (I) The Continuous Presence Of A Complex Topography In The Middle East And Central Asia Since Tertiary Times, Which Created A Wide Range Of Environmental Niches And Facilitated The Formation And Persistence Of Isolated Populations Over Long Periods, (Ii) Relatively Stable Climate During The Late Miocene-Pliocene Compared To The Quaternary Period That Caused Small Species Range Shifts And Gene Flow, And (Iii) A Dampened Impact Of Multiple Glacial-Interglacial Cycles On The Mountain Regions Of Sw Asia Compared To The Higher Latitude European Mountain Ranges. This Left An Extensive, Non-Glaciated Altitudinal Zone For The Survival Of Irano-Turanian Species, Thereby Reducing Extinction During Glacial Periods. During Interglacial Periods, Many Cousinia Species May Have Been Geographically Isolated In High Mountain Interglacial Refugia Of The Irano-Turanian Region. Overall, The Combination Of The Above Factors During The Neogene Resulted In Geographical Isolation And Reduced Gene Flow, Thereby Fostering Allopatric Speciation In Cousinia And Probably Also In Many Other Speciose Irano-Turanian Plant Taxa. 2012 Elsevier B.V..

Tracing Hydro-Climatic And Land-Use Changes To Better Understand The Lake Urmia Tragedy	Journal Of Hydrology	Lake Urmiaa Shallow Endemic Hypersaline Lake In Northwest Iranhas Undergone A Dramatic Decline In Its Water Level (Wl), By About 8 M, Since 1995. The Primary Cause Of The Wl Decline In Lake Urmia Has Been Debated In The Scientific Literature, Regarding Whether It Has Been Predominantly Driven By Atmospheric Climate Change Or By Human Activities In The Watershed Landscape. Using Available Climate, Hydrological, And Vegetation Data For The Period 19812015, This Study Analyzes And Aims To Explain The Lake Desiccation Based On Other Observed Hydro-Climatic And Vegetation Changes In The Lake Urmia Watershed And Classical Exploratory Statistical Methods. The Analysis Accounts For The Relationships Between Atmospheric Climate Change (Precipitation P, Temperature T), And Hydrological (Soil Moisture Sm, And Wl) And Vegetation Cover (Vc, Including Agricultural Crops And Other Vegetation) Changes In The Landscape. Results Show That P, T, And Sm Changes Cannot Explain The Sharp Decline In Lake Wl Since 2000. Instead, The Agricultural Increase Of Vc In The Watershed Correlates Well With The Lake Wl Change, Indicating This Human-Driven Vc And Associated Irrigation Expansion As The Dominant Human Driver Of The Lake Urmia Desiccation. Specifically, The Greater Transpiration From The Expanded And Increasingly Irrigated Agricultural Crops Implies Increased Total Evapotranspiration And Associated Consumptive Use Of Water (Inherently Related To The Irrigation And Water Diversion And Storage Developments In The Watershed). Thereby The Runoff From The Watershed Into The Lake Has Decreased, And The Remaining Smaller Inflow To The Lake Has Been Insufficient For Keeping Up The Previous Lake Wl, Causing The Observed Wl Drop To Current Conditions. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Given The Fluctuations Of The Lake Over Geological Times, We Thus Hypothesized That Species Identification Of Artemia Cysts, Buried In The Sediments, Can Provide Information On Lake Conditions In The Past. Therefore, Encysted Embryos Of Artemia Were Recovered From Lake Sediments By Augering At A Site Near The Present Shoreline. Cysts And Associated Plant Remains From Two Studied Levels Yielded Radiocarbon Ages In The Range 5,000-6,700 Ybp. For Determination Of The Type Of Artemia, The Constant Synonym Mutation In Exon-7 Of The Na/K Atpase Gene Was Verified, And The Diameter Of The Recovered Cysts Was Compared With That Of Modern Cysts From The Lake Urmia Region. The Results Show That The Cysts Represent A Parthenogenetic Type Of Artemia, Whose Cyst Diameter Is Somewhat Different From That Of Present-Day Local Parthenogenetic Artemia. The Present Study Firstly Confirms The Stability Of Dna In Ancient Artemia Cysts For Molecular Analysis. Moreover, It Suggests Variation In Lake Urmia'S Conditions Over Time, And Based On Comparison With Salinity Preferences Of Contemporary Artemia Populations, It More Specifically Suggests That Lake Urmia Was A Brackish Lake Dominated By A Parthenogenetic Artemia Population In The Geological Period Sampled. It Finally Illustrates How, Like In The Study Of Freshwater Propagule Banks, Paleogenetic Analysis Of Artemia Dna Recovered From Sediment Cores Can Be Used As A Tool In The Paleoecological Study Of Generally Highly Fluctuating Saline Habitats. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

The Pollen Record Indicates That Riella Aff. Cossoniana Trab. Has Played An Important Role In The Aquatic Vegetation In The Plains Around Lake Urmia, Particularly In The Late Pleistocene. The Concentration Of Riella Spores Was Greater During The High Lake Stands Corresponding To The Middle Part Of The Last Glaciations (Mis 3) And The Upper Part Of The Penultimate Glaciations (Mis 6). The Presence Of Riella Suggests That During These Periods Numerous Brackish Ponds And Marshes Developed On The Present Salt Flats Around The Lake, Creating Suitable Habitat For Colonization.

Urmia Lake Is The Second Hyper-Saline Lake In The World And There Is A Significant Salinity Gradient Between The Lake'S Water And The Waters Of Those Rivers That Flow Into The Lake. A Methodology For Determining The Feasibility For Electrical Production Using Salinity Gradient Power (Sgp) Is Developed For Two Different Types Of Systems Using This Location As An Example. Reverse Electrodialysis (Red) And Pressure Retarded Osmosis (Pro), The Gadar Chay River Is One Of Thirteen Rivers That Run Into Urmia Lake, It Supports About 10% Of The Lake'S Water. In This Study, Important Parameters Such As River Discharge And The Salinity Content Of River And Lake'S Waters For Several Years Were Investigated. The Theoretical And Technical Potential Of Salinity Gradient Energy Was Also Determined. These Calculations Indicate That 206.08 Mw Of Electrical Power Could Be Produced At This Location When The River Flow Is Approximately 29.82 M3/S And They Illustrates The Potential For Salinity Gradient Energy Extraction Between Urmia Lake And The Gadar Chay River.

The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (Grace) Mission Offers A Unique Possibility Of Monitoring Total Water Storage (Tws) Changes. An Accurate Estimation Of Terrestrial And Surface Ws Changes From Grace-Tws Products, However, Requires A Proper Signal Separation Procedure. To Perform This Separation, This Study Proposes A Statistical Approach That Uses A Priori Spatial Patterns Of Terrestrial And Surface Ws Changes From A Hydrological Model And Altimetry Data. The Patterns Are Then Adjusted To Grace-Tws Products Using A Least Squares Adjustment (Lsa) Procedure, Thereby Making The Best Use Of The Available Data. For The Period Of October 2002 To March 2011, Monthly Grace-Tws Changes Were Derived Over A Broad Region Encompassing Iran. A Priori Patterns Were Derived By Decomposing The Following Auxiliary Data Into Statistically Independent Components: (I) Terrestrial Ws Change Outputs Of The Global Land Data Assimilation System (Gldas), (Ii) Steric-Corrected Surface Ws Changes Of The Caspian Sea, (Iii) That Of The Persian And Oman Gulfs, (Iv) Ws Changes Of The Aral Sea, And (V) That Of Small Lakes Of The Selected Region. Finally, The Patterns Of (I) To (V) Were Adjusted To Grace-Tws Maps So That Their Contributions Were Estimated And Grace-Tws Signals Separated. After Separation, Our Results Indicated That The Annual Amplitude Of Ws Changes Over The Caspian Sea Was 152. Mm, 101. Mm Over Both The Persian And Oman Gulfs, And 71. Mm For The Aral Sea. Since January 2005, Terrestrial Ws In Most Parts Of Iran, Specifically Over The Center And Northwestern Parts, Exhibited A Mass Decrease With An Average Linear Rate Of ~. 15. Mm/Yr. The Estimated Linear Trends Of Groundwater Storage For The Drought Period Of 2005 To March 2011, Corresponding To The Six Main Basins Of Iran: Khazar, Persian And Oman Gulfs, Urmia, Markazi, Hamoon, And Srakhs Were -6.7, -6.1, -11.2, -9.1, -3.1, And -4.2.

Tbz23, Isolated From Urmia Lake In Iran	Advances In Environmental Biology	Iron Is An Important Abundant Element In The Environment, Which Its Mobility And Stability Is Partly Under The Control Of Oxidation State. Microbial Iron Reduction Plays An Important Role In The Iron Cycle And Affects The Exchange Of Nutrients And Trace Elements In Ecosystems. Dissimilatory Reduction Of Ferric Iron Oxides Plays An Important Role In Mineralization Of Organic Materials In Anoxic Soils And Sediments And Also Makes Up An Important Fraction Of Anaerobic Carbon Metabolism In Special Marine And Freshwater Environments. Some Bacteria And Archaea Can Grow Anaerobically Using Fe(Iii) As The Sole Electron Acceptor And Some Fungi Also Are Able To Reduce Fe(Iii) To Fe(Ii). In This Study, Iron Reduction Was Investigated Using Bacterial Isolates Tbz9 And Tbz23, Isolated From Urmia Lake In Iran. Differential Pulse Polarography Was Exploited To Measure Different Reduced Forms Of Iron In Control And Treated Samples. The Results Showed That Both Isolates Are Able To Reduce Fe(Iii) To Fe(Ii) And Fe(Ii) To Metallic Fe. Based On Intensity Of Differential Pulse Polarogram Peaks Observed Respectively At - 0.34V And -0.51 V, It Seems That Tbz23 Reduces Almost 14.11% Of Available Fe(Iii) To Fe(Ii) And This Reduction Rate Is About 72.12% For Tbz9 During 10 Days Of Incubation. The Rate Of Reducing Fe(Ii) To Metallic Fe Is Seemingly 21.14% For Tbz23 And 64.79% For Tbz9 During 10 Days Of Incubation. Therefore, Isolate Tbz9 Is An Environmental Bacterium With Higher Potential To Reduce Ferric Iron To Ferrous Iron And Also To Reduce Ferrous Iron To Metallic Iron. Consequently, This Isolate Can Play An Important Role In Environmental Cycling Of Iron, Carbon, And Other Elements. 2014 Aensi Publisher All Rights Reserved.

High Lake Levels Are Generally Observed During The Interglacial And Interstadial Periods, Which Are Marked By Deposition Of Varved Sediments With High Total Organic Carbon (Toc), Total Inorganic Carbon (Tic), Low Detrital Influx (High Ca/F) And High 18O And 13C Values Of Authigenic Carbonate. During The Glacial And Stadial Periods Of 71-58Kabp (Marine Isotope Stage 4, Mis4) And End Of Last Glaciation-Deglaciation (30-14.5Kabp, Mis3) Relatively Low Lake Levels Prevailed, And Grey Homogeneous To Faintly Laminated Clayey Silts Were Deposited At High Sedimentation And Low Organic Productivity Rates.Millennial-Scale Variability Of The Proxies During 60-30Kabp (Mis3 Is Correlated With The Dansgaard-Oeschger (D-O)) And Holocene Abrupt Climate Events In The Atlantic. These Events Are Characterized By Laminated Sediments, With High Toc, Tic, Ca/Fe, 18O And 13C Values. The Lake Van Nb Records Correlate Well In The Region With The Climate Records From The Lakes Zeribar And Urmia In Iran And The Sofular Cave In Nw Anatolia, But Are In General In Anti-Phase To Those From The Dead Sea Basin (Lake Lisan) In The Levant. The Relatively Higher 18O Values (0 To-0.4) For The Interglacial And Interstadial Periods In The Lake Van Nb Section Are Due To The Higher Temperature And Seasonality Of Precipitation And Higher Evaporation, Whereas The Lower Values (-0.8 To-2) During The Glacial And Stadial Periods Are Caused Mainly By Relative Decrease In Both Temperature And Seasonality Of Precipitation. The High 18O Values (Up To 4.2) During The Younger Dryas, Together With The Presence Of Dolomite And Low Toc Contents, Supports Evaporative Conditions And Low Lake Level. A Gradual Decrease In The 18O Values From An Average Of-0.4 During The Humid Early Holocene To An Average Of-3.5 During The More Arid Late Holocene Suggests An Increasing Contribution Of Winter Precipitation. The Changes In The Seasonality Of Precipitation In Eastern Anatolia Are Probably Caused By Changes In The Temperatures Of North Atlantic And Mediterranean And In The Strength Of Siberian High. 2014 Elsevier Ltd.	90Ka Climate Records, Icdp Paleovan, Lake Level, Lake Van, Multproxy Analyses, Northern Basin, Climate Record, Icdp Paleovan, Lake Levels, Lake Vans, Multproxy Analyses, Northern Basins, Authigenesis, Climate Variation, Dansgaard-Oeschger Cycle, Holocene, Interstadial, Lake Level, Marine Isotope Stage, Paleoclimate, Precipitation (Climatology), Proxy Climate Record, Anatolia, Atlantic Ocean, Iran, Kordestan, Lake Urmia, Lake Van, Lake Zeribar, Levant, Mediterranean Region, Turkey	10.1016/J.QUASCIREV.2014.09.027	97-116	Scopus	104	2014

In Order To Analyze These Changes During The Recent Decade, In This Study, We Assimilate Terrestrial Water Storage (Tws) Data From The Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (Grace) Into The World-Wide Water Resources Assessment (W3Ra) Model. This Assimilation Improves Model Derived Water Storage Simulations By Introducing Missing Trends And Correcting The Amplitude And Phase Of Seasonal Water Storage Variations. The Ensemble Square-Root Filter (Ensrf) Technique Is Applied, Which Showed Stable Performance In Propagating Errors During The Assimilation Period (20022012). Our Focus Is On Sub-Surface Water Storage Changes Including Groundwater And Soil Moisture Variations Within Six Major Drainage Divisions Covering The Whole Iran Including Its Eastern Part (East), Caspian Sea, Centre, Sarakhs, Persian Gulf And Oman Sea, And Lake Urmia. Results Indicate An Average Of -8.9 Mm/Year Groundwater Reduction Within Iran During The Period 2002 To 2012. A Similar Decrease Is Also Observed In Soil Moisture Storage Especially After 2005. We Further Apply The Canonical Correlation Analysis (Cca) Technique To Relate Sub-Surface Water Storage Changes To Climate (E.G., Precipitation) And Anthropogenic (E.G., Farming) Impacts. Results Indicate An Average Correlation Of 0.81 Between Rainfall And Groundwater Variations And Also A Large Impact Of Anthropogenic Activities (Mainly For Irrigations) On Iran'S Water Storage Depletions. 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Canonical Correlation Analysis, Data Assimilation, Grace, Groundwater Storage, Iran, W3Ra Hydrological Model, Water Storage Depletion, Climate Change, Climate Models, Correlation Methods, Groundwater, Hydrology, Rain, Soil Moisture, Surface Waters, Water Conservation, Water Supply, Canonical Correlation Analysis, Data Assimilation, Grace, Groundwater Storage, Hydrological Modeling, Iran, Water Storage, Digital Storage, Canonical Analysis, Correlation, Data Assimilation, Grace, Groundwater, Hydrological Modeling, Resource Depletion, Seasonality, Soil Moisture, Water Storage, Iran	10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2018.02.008	43848	Scopus	114	2018

Nov., An Extremely Halophilic Archaeon From A Salt Lake	International Journal Of Systematic And Evolutionary Microbiology	An Extremely Halophilic Archaeon, Strain Da50T, Was Isolated From A Brine Sample Of Urmia Lake, A Hypersaline Environment In North-West Iran. Strain Da50T Was Orange-Pigmented, Motile, Pleomorphic And Required At Least 2.5 M Nacl But Not Mgcl<Inf>2</Inf> For Growth. Optimal Growth Was Achieved At 4.0 M Nacl And 0.3 M Mgcl<Inf>2</Inf>. The Optimum Ph And Temperature For Growth Were Ph 7.0 And 45 C, While It Was Able To Grow Over A Ph Range Of 6.5-8.0 And A Temperature Range Of 25-50 C. Analysis Of 16S Rrna Gene Sequences Revealed That Strain Da50T Is A Member Of The Family Halobacteriaceae, Showing A Low Level Of Similarity With Other Members Of This Family. Highest Similarities, 94.4, 94.0 And 93.9%, Were Obtained With The 16S Rrna Gene Sequences Of The Type Strains Of Natrialba Aegyptia, Halobiforma Lacisalsi And Halovivax Asiaticus, Respectively. Polar Lipid Analyses Revealed That Strain Da50T Contains Phosphatidylglycerol And Phosphatidylglycerol Phosphate Methyl Ester. Four Unidentified Glycolipids And Two Minor Phospholipids Were Also Observed. The Only Quinone Present Was Mk-8(Ii-H<Inf>2</Inf>). The G + C Content Of Its Dna Was 62.3 Mol%. On The Basis Of The Data Obtained, The New Isolate Could Not Be Classified In Any Recognized Genus. Strain Da50T Is Thus Considered To Represent A Novel Species Of A New Genus Within The Family Halobacteriaceae, Order Halobacteriales, For Which The Name Halovarius Luteus Gen. Nov Sp. Nov. Is Proposed. The Type Strain Of Halovarius Luteus Is Da50T (=Ibrc-M 10912T=Cect 8510T). 2015 Iums.

Owing To Its Unique Biodiversity And Special Environmental Conditions, Urmia Lake National Park Has Been Designated As One Of The Biosphere Reserves By Unesco. This Study Was Aimed To Characterize Basidiomycetous Yeasts In Hypersaline Soils Surrounding The Urmia Lake National Park Using A Polyphasic Combination Of Molecular And Physiological Data. Soil Samples Were Collected From Eight Sites In Lake Basin And Six Islands Insides The Lake. Yeast Strains Were Identified By Sequencing The D1/D2 Domains Of The 26S Rrna Gene. When D1/D2 Domain Sequencing Did Not Resolve The Identity Of The Species, Strain Identification Was Obtained By Its 1 & 2 Sequencing. Twenty-One Species Belonging To The Genera Cystobasidium, Holtermanniella, Naganishia, Rhodotorula, Saitozyma, Solicoccozyma, Tausonia, Vanrija, And Vishniacozyma Were Identified. Solicoccozyma Aeria Represented The Dominant Species. The Ability Of Isolates To Grow At 10 And 15% Of Nacl Was Checked, About Two-Thirds Of The Strains Grew At 10%, While About 13% Of The Isolates Grew In Medium With 15% Nacl.

Article	Talebi, T//Ramezani, E//Djamali, M//Lahijani, Hak//Naqinezhad, A//Alizadeh, K//Andrieu, Ponel, V	The Late-Holocene Climate Change, Vegetation Dynamics, Lake-Level Changes And Anthropogenic Impacts In The Lake Urmia Region, Nw Iran	Quaternary International	Two Short (100 And 175 Cm-Long) Sediment Cores From The Southwestern Corner Of Lake Urmia Provide A Record Of Vegetation Dynamics, Lake-Level Changes And The Role Of Climate And Humans In Shaping The Landscape Around Lake Urmia Over The Last 2550 Years. Relatively Low Values Of Arboreal Pollen (Ap), And Substantial Values Of Artemisia Pollen From 2550 To 1500 Cal Bp Indicate The Prevalence Of Steppe Vegetation And Relatively Arid Climate In The Area. However, A Prominent Peak Of Riella Spores May Indicate A Short-Lived Lake-Level Rise For The Period 1900-2000 Cal Bp. The Next Period, 1500-550 Cal Bp, Is Characterized By Substantial Rise In Ap, Particularly Quercus. , And A Sharp Decline Of Artemisia, Chenopodiaceae/Amaranthaceae And Wetland Pollen Types, Suggesting The Expansion Of Oak Forests Under A Rather Moist Climate And/Or A Decline In Agro-Sylvo-Pastoral Practices In The Area. Agricultural Activity In The Area Can Be Inferred From Sporadic Occurrences Of Vitis, Ricinus And Juglans Pollen From The Beginning Of The Record. The Rise Of Saline Habitat Pollen Types Between 1100 And 800 Cal Bp, Along With Increased Values Of Magnetic Susceptibility And Organic Matter, Suggest A Lower Water Level And The Subaerial Exposure Of Saline Mud Flats, Which Could Favour The Re-Colonization Of Chenopods And Other Halophytes Around The Margins Of The Lake. Thus, The Medieval Climatic Anomaly Seems To Be Warmer-Than-Present In The Lake Urmia Region. From 450 To 150 Cal Bp, The Decline In Quercus And High Values Of Artemisia. , Along With Higher Lake Levels And High Magnetic Susceptibility Values, Could Be Associated With The Little Ice Age. Since 500 Cal Bp, Quercus And Riella Steadily Decline And Fade Out Towards The Surface Of The Core, Whereas Pollen Types Attributable To Steppe And Desert Vegetation Increase. A Prominent Increase In Organic Matter In The Uppermost Part Of The Record Could Be Associated With A Lower Lake Level And The Expansion Of Wetland Vegetation In The Recent Past. Our Findings Suggest That The Regional Forest Coverage In The Highlands Of Zagros And Azerbaijan Has Reached Its Minimum During Recent Decades, While Urmia'S Lake Level Dropped Dramatically (Increasing Its Water Salinity) Most Likely As A Function Of Extensive Anthropogenic Activities And General Climate Aridification. 2015 Elsevier Ltd And Inqua.

Artemia Therefore Possess Significant Genetic Diversity, Which Gives Them Their Outstanding Adaptability. To Understand This Remarkable Plasticity, We Sequenced The Mitochondrial Genomes Of Two Artemia Tibetiana Isolates From The Tibetan Plateau In China And One Artemia Urmiana Isolate From Lake Urmia In Iran And Compared Them With The Genome Of A Low-Altitude Artemia, A. Franciscana. We Compared The Ratio Of The Rate Of Nonsynonymous (Ka) And Synonymous (Ks) Substitutions (Ka/Ks Ratio) In The Mitochondrial Protein-Coding Gene Sequences And Found That Atp8 Had The Highest Ka/Ks Ratios In Comparisons Of A. Franciscana With Either A. Tibetiana Or A. Urmiana And That Atp6 Had The Highest Ka/Ks Ratio Between A. Tibetiana And A. Urmiana. Atp6 May Have Experienced Strong Selective Pressure For High-Altitude Adaptation Because Although A. Tibetiana And A. Urmiana Are Closely Related They Live At Different Altitudes. We Identified Two Extended Termination-Associated Sequences And Three Conserved Sequence Blocks In The D-Loop Region Of The Mitochondrial Genomes. We Propose That Sequence Variations In The D-Loop Region And In The Subunits Of The Respiratory Chain Complexes Independently Or Collectively Contribute To The Adaptation Of Artemia To Different Altitudes. 2013 The Author(S).

Experiments Were Carried Out In The Laboratory And In The Field. Cysts, Collected From Different Sites Of The Lake And Peripheral Lagoons, Were Hatched And Cultured To Adults In The Laboratory. Adult Sexual And Parthenogenetic Animals Were Isolated And Newly Hatched Nauplii From Them Were Cultured To Maturity In Different Salinities, Ranging From 15-80 Ppt. Survival Levels And Percentage Of Animals Attaining Adulthood Were Measured Over A Period Of 30 Days. In The Field Experiment, Cysts Taken From Lake Urmia Were Hatched And The Resulting Nauplii Were Inoculated Into Six Earthen Ponds (80-140 Ppt) Constructed In The Vicinity Of The Lake. Population Composition In Each Pond Was Determined Over A Period Of Two Years. Results Indicated That Both Sexual And Parthenogenetic Artemia Coexist In Lake Urmia. While The Lake Itself Is Dominated By Sexual Artemia, The Asexual Populations Were Found To Be Restricted To Particular Areas In Or Near The Lake. Artemia Appearing Seasonally In The Lagoons Adjacent To The Lake Were Exclusively Parthenogenetic. Parthenogens Could Grow, Mature And Reproduce At Very Low Salinities (15-33 Ppt), Whereas Higher Salinities (Above 50 Ppt) Were Required For A. Urmiana To Attain Sexual Maturity. We Consider Salinity To Be A Major Abiotic Factor Determining The Distribution Of These Sexually Different Populations Within And Outside The Lake. 2007 Wiley-Vch Verlag Gmbh & Co. Kgaa.

The Cysts Of Parthenogenetic Strains Were Collected From Maharlu, Incheh, Varmal And Qom Salt Lakes And Lagoons At The Periphery Of Lake Urmia. Cysts Of The Bisexual Artemia Urmiana Were Collected From The Lake Urmia. All Cysts Strains Were Hatched Using The Standard Procedures And The Nauplii From All Populations Were Reared At 80 G L-1 At Laboratory Conditions. Survival And Total Length Of The Artemia Were Measured On Days 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 And 23 Of Culture. Randomly Selected Adult Animals Were Studied For Eight Reproductive And Four Life Span Characteristics. The Findings Showed That Parthenogenetic Artemia From Maharlu, Incheh Lakes And From Lagoons At The Vicinity Of The Lake Urmia Had Significantly Highest (P&Lt,0.05) Values Of Survival Rate (73 And 62.8%, Respectively) Compared To Bisexual A.

Isolated Strains From These Saline Lakes Were Found To Be Halotolerant, Moderately And Extremely Halophilic Bacteria. The Bacteria In Each Saline Lake Were Able To Produce Different Hydrolytic Enzymes Including Amylase, Protease, Lipase, Dnase, Inulinase, Xylanase, Carboxy Methyl Cellulase, Pectinase And Pullulanase. 188, 302, 91 Halophilic Strains Were Isolated From Urmia Lake, Howz-Soltan And Aran-Bidgol Playa, Respectively. The Numbers Of Gram-Positive Strains Were More Than Gram-Negatives, And Among Gram-Positive Bacteria, Spore-Forming Bacilli Were Most Abundant. Due To The Unique Physico-Chemical Conditions Of The Lake Environments, The Hydrolytic Activities Of Isolated Strains Were Significantly Different. For Instance, Isolated Strains From Howz-Soltan Playa Did Not Produce Pectinase, Dnase, Amylase, Lipase And Inulinase, While The Isolates From Aran-Bidgol Playa Had A Great Ability To Produce Pectinase And Dnase. The Strains From Urmia Lake Were Also Good Producers Of Dnase But Failed To Show Any Chitinase Activity.

Totally, 29 Groundwater Samples Were Collected From Wells In August 2016, And The Values Of 23 Parameters, Namely Ph, Electrical Conductivity, Concentration Of Major Elements (Ca2+, Mg2+, Na+, K+, Hco3 , So4 2, Cl), Minor Elements (No3 , F, B, And Br) And Heavy Metal(Loid)S (Fe, Al, Cr, Mn, As, Zn, Pb, Cu, And Ni) Were Measured. The Results Indicate That Some Samples Were Found With As, Pb, And Zn Concentrations Exceeding Who Standards For Drinking Water. Results Of Correlation Coefficients Between The Measured Variables Reflect The Occurrence Of Weathering And Dissolution Of Rocks, Especially Silicates And Evaporites, With Ion Exchange And Geochemical Characteristics Similar To The Release Of Some Heavy Metal(Loid)S. According To Hierarchical Cluster Analysis, Samples Of Cluster 1 Are Affected By Alkalinity And Accompanied By Elements Compatible With Alkaline Ambience (Co3 2 And Ni). Samples Of Subcluster 2-1 Demonstrate The Effect Of Salinity, Attributed To Evaporates, Irrigation Return Flow, And Influx Of Urmia Lakes Brine, While, Samples Of Sub-Cluster 2-2 Are Influenced By Agricultural Activities. Factor Analysis Results Illustrate The Effects Of Five Factors On The Quality Of Groundwater. The Factor Analysis Accounts For The 71.9% Of Total Variance Of Groundwater Quality For Geogenic Impacts, While 10% Of The Groundwater Quality Variance Is Controlled By Agricultural Activities Which Produce Excessive Amounts Of No3 Along With Zn Which Is Contained In Fertilizers And Agrochemicals.

The Saline Dust Storm Differs From Common Dust Storm, Especially Considering The Sources Of The Suspended Particulate Matter (Pm), Chemical Composition, Grain Size, And Circulation Processes. Atmospheric Particulate Matters (Tsp, Pm10 Pm2.5 And Pm1) And Their Water-Soluble Ions Were Concurrently Measured At Two Sites Located At North And Southeast Part Of Urmia Lake From January 2013 To September 2013. Particulate Matters (Pms) Were Measured Using High Volume Sampler And Haz-Dust Epam-5000 Particulate Air Monitors. In Both Of The Sampling Sites, The Highest Concentration Of Pm Was Observed During The Summer Season (521.6, 329.1, 42.6, And 36.5 For Tsp, Pm10, Pm2.5 And Pm1 Respectively). A Total Of 11 Inorganic Water-Soluble Ions In The Tsp And Pm10 Were Identified By Ion Chromatography (Ic). No Statistically Significant Difference Was Found Between Pm'S Ions Concentrations Of Two Sampling Sites. The Average Of The Total Measured Water-Soluble Ions In The Sampling Sites Was 28.75 12.9 G/M3 (11.9 4.8% Of Total Tsp Mass) For Tsp And 14.65 7.1G/M3 (8.7 4.4 Of Total Pm10 Mass) For Pm10. Among All Detected Ions, Sulfate Was The Dominant Constituent Followed By Nitrate And Sodium. This Study Showed That The Water Soluble Salts Compose 3-20% Of The Total Mass Of Tsp And Pm10. The Pca Analysis Showed That Saline Particulates Formed From Urmia Lake Bed Were The Dominant Source (57.6 %) Of Tsp.

According To The Levels Of Air Pollution Tolerance Index (Apti), Popolus Alba Showed To Be More Sensitive To Air Pollution And Can Be Applied For Biomonitoring. The Ranks Of Heavy Metals And Sodium Concentrations In The Leaves Gained In The Order Of Na > Zn > Cu > Ni > Pb > As > Cd. The Mean Enrichment Factor For The Elements Was Calculated From 1 To 3, Suggesting Minor Enrichment For Them. As, Pb, And Na With Similar Spatial Distribution Were Dominantly Observed In Northwest And Center-East Of The Urmia Lake. Potential Ecological Risk (Per) Index Showed A Moderate Risk In 6% Of Sampling Zones, Where Cd And As Were Identified As Responsible Pollutants. Principle Component And Correlation Analysis Between The Elements Depicted Human Sources Such As Industrial Activity And Road Traffic For Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb, And Zn, Whereas As And Na Were Most Likely Originated From The Aerosols Of Urmia Lake. Our Findings Showed That Popolus Alba Can Be Applied As A Local Biomonitor And Vitis Vinifera With Moderate Tolerance Can Be Used As A Good Air Pollutant Sink In Greenbelt Development Around The Drying Urmia Lake In The Northwest Of Iran. 2018, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Germany, Part Of Springer Nature.

The Lake Has Been Facing A Serious Environmental Crisis, Due To Water Mismanagement In The Basin. To Address This Problem, An Analysis Of The Hydrodynamic Behavior And Of Salinity Distribution Is Important. The Three-Dimensional Numerical Model Mike 3 Flow Model Fm Was Employed In This Study. Model Sensitivity Analyses Revealed That Wind Speed, Friction Coefficient, And Vertical Eddy Viscosity Are Effective Parameters On Both Flow Velocities And Salinity Distribution, While Bottom Roughness Height Has Minor Effects On Surface Velocities. Reduced Value For Vertical Eddy Viscosity Improves The Simulation Of The Velocity Field And Has An Adverse Effect On Salinity Distribution. The Unesco Density Function Leads To An Overestimation Of Density. Yet, Final Model Results Are Accurate Enough To Reproduce The Salinity Distribution Over The Lake, Revealing That The Salinity Difference Between North And South Basins Of Lake Urmia Increases Significantly In The Wet Season, Due To Southern Rivers Inflows By Snowmelt. For The Simulated Periods Of 19861987 And 20042005, Natural And Man-Induced Drought Hydrological Conditions, The Direction Of Flows Was From South To North, With A Much Lower Net Flow In The Latter Period. This Decrease In The Exchanged Flows Causes Higher Salinity Difference Among Basins. Results Indicate That The Present Model Could Be Run For Any Time Period In Both Normal And Drought Conditions And Can Satisfactorily Simulate The Hydrodynamic Characteristics And Salinity Distribution Of Lake Urmia For Management Purposes. 2019, 2019 Japan Society Of Civil Engineers.

On Average, The Ratio Of Irrigation To Evapotranspiration In This Basin Is More Than 73%. Investigating The Irrigation Water Requirement Pattern Changes And The Spatial Distribution Of Evapotranspiration During The Basin Development Period On A Regional Scale Play Important Roles In Understanding The Basin Situation. In This Study, The Actual Evapotranspiration Has Been Estimated By Sebal Model. By Estimating The Precipitation Distribution In The Basin, The Agricultural Irrigation Water Requirement Pattern Has Been Calculated Using The Land Use Map In 1995, 2010 And 2014 In The Total Agricultural Lands And In Its 7 Major Subbasins Where Et Changes From 369 To 1000 Mm. The Maximum Irrigation Water Consumption Were 535 Million Cubic Meters In Urmia Subbasin (2010) And Then 469 Million Cubic Meters In Miandoab Subbasin (2014), While Its Average Was 2108 Million Cubic Meters In The Basin. Furthermore, The Maximum And Minimum Levels Of Evapotranspiration Pattern In The Total Agricultural Lands Were 765 And 555 Mm In 2010 And 1995, Respectively. This Study Included (1) A Comparison Between Regional Irrigation Water Requirement In The Basin And (2) Investigating The Causes Of (Including Natural And Anthropogenic) Changes In The Amount Of Irrigation Water Consumption Over The Years.

Article	Taravat, A//Rajaei, M//Emadodin, I//Hasheminejad, H//Mousavian, R//Biniyaz, E	A Spaceborne Multisensory, Multitemporal Approach To Monitor Water Level And Storage Variations Of Lakes	Water (Switzerland)	Lake Urmia, The Second Largest Saline Lake On Earth And A Highly Endangered Ecosystem, Is On The Brink Of A Serious Environmental Disaster Similar To The Catastrophic Death Of The Aral Sea. Progressive Drying Has Been Observed During The Last Decade, Causing Dramatic Changes To Lake Urmia'S Surface And Its Regional Water Supplies. The Present Study Aims To Improve Monitoring Of Spatiotemporal Changes Of Lake Urmia In The Period 1975-2015 Using The Multi-Temporal Satellite Altimetry And Landsat (5-Tm, 7-Etm+ And 8-Oli) Images. In Order To Demonstrate The Impacts Of Climate Change And Human Pressure On The Variations In Surface Extent And Water Level, Lake Sevan And Van Lake With Different Characteristics Were Studied Along With The Urmia Lake. Normalized Difference Water Index-Principal Components Index (Ndwi-Pcs), Normalized Difference Water Index (Ndwi), Modified Ndwi (Mndwi), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (Ndmi),Water Ratio Index (Wri), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi), Automatedwater Extraction Index (Awei), And Multilayer Perceptron Neural Networks (Mlp Nns) Classifier Were Investigated For The Extraction Of Surface Water From Landsat Data. The Presented Results Revealed That Mlp Nns Has A Better Performance In The Cases Where The Other Models Generate Poor Accuracy. The Results Show That The Area Of Lake Sevan And Van Lake Have Increased While The Area Of Lake Urmia Has Decreased By ~65.23% In The Past Decades, Far More Than Previously Reported (~25% To 50%). Urmia Lake'S Shoreline Has Been Receding Severely Between 2010 And 2015 With No Sign Of Recovery, Which Has Been Partly Blamed On Prolonged Droughts, Aggressive Regional Water Resources Development Plans, Intensive Agricultural Activities, And Anthropogenic Changes To The System. The Results Also Indicated That (Among The Proposed Factors) Changes In Inflows Due To Overuse Of Surface Water Resources And Constructing Dams (Mostly During 1995-2005) Are The Main Reasons For Urmia Lake'S Shoreline Receding. The Model Presented In This Manuscript Can Be Used By Managers As A Decision Support System To Find The Effects Of Building New Dams Or Other Infrastructures. 2016 By The Authors, Licensee Mdpi, Basel, Switzerland.

The High Importance Of The Lake'S Watershed For Human Life Demands A Comprehensive Monitoring Of The Watershed'S Behavior. Spaceborne Sensors Provide A Number Of Novel Ways To Monitor The Hydrological Cycle And Its Interannual Changes. The Use Of Grace Gravity Data Makes It Possible To Determine Continental Water Storage Changes And To Assess The Water Budget On Monthly To Multi-Annual Time Scales. We Use Satellite Altimetry Data From Envisat And Cryosat-2 To Monitor The Lake Water Level. Moreover, We Employ Optical Satellite Imagery To Determine The Surface Water Extent Of The Lake Repeatedly And At An Appropriate Time Interval.Our Altimetry Results Indicate That, On Average, The Lake Has Lost 341Cm Of Its Water Level Every Year From 2002 To 2014. The Results From Satellite Imagery Reveal A Loss Of Water Extent At An Average Rate Of 2206Km2/Yr, Which Indicates That The Lake Has Lost About 70% Of Its Surface Area Over The Last 14Years. By Combining Water Level From Altimetry, Surface Water Extent From Satellite Imagery And Local Bathymetry, We Ascertain The Changes In Lake Volume. Results Indicate That The Lake Volume Has Been Decreasing At An Alarming Rate Of 1.030.02Km3/Yr. The Water Volume Of The Lake Behaves Differently From The Water Storage Of The Whole Basin Captured By Grace. Our Results Show That The Onset Of A Drought In 2007 Over This Region Together With An Increase In The Rate Of Groundwater Depletion Caused A New Equilibrium Level For Water Storage Of The Whole Basin. Comparing The Results From Grace And The Obtained Water Volume In The Lake With In Situ Groundwater Level Data Reveals The Anthropogenic Influences On An Accelerated Lake Desiccation. In Fact, Our Monitoring Approach Raises Critical Issues Regarding Water Use In The Basin And Highlights The Important Role Of Spaceborne Sensors For Any Urgent Or Long-Term Treatment Plan. 2014 Elsevier Inc.All Rights Reserved.

Article	Abbaspour, M//Javid, Ah//Mirbagheri, Sa//Givi, Fa//Moghimi, P	Investigation Of Lake Drying Attributed To Climate Change	International Journal Of Environmental Science And Technology	In Recent Decades, Climate Change Has Been Of Great Concern Due To Its Effect On Water Level And Its Impact On Aquatic Ecosystems. Urmia Lake, The Largest Inland Wetland In Iran, Has Been Shrinking. There Is A Great Concern Whether It Will Dry Up Like The Aral Sea. Therefore, A Hydrodynamic Model Has Been Developed To Simulate The Condition Of Urmia Lake. The Model Has Been Validated Using The Known Annual Data On Precipitation, Evaporation, Run Off, River Discharges And Water Level Which Are Available For The Last 35 Years. Different Hydrological Conditions Regarding Lake Input And Output Data Were Tested And Water Depth Was Calculated Using Bathymetry To Predict Water-Level Fluctuations In The Future. The Results Predict That The Water Level Will Decrease Continuously. The Lake Will Be Dried Up In About 10 Years If Very Dry Conditions Continue In The Region. The Drought Speed Cannot Be Reduced And There Is No Potential To Develop A Water-Usage Program. Besides, The Lake Water Depth Decrease Is More Slightly, Applying Alternate Wet And Dry-Period Conditions. In Some Hydrological Conditions There Is A Good Potential To Consider Water Development Projects. The Sensitivity Analysis Of Different Parameters Indicates That The Lake Is Highly Sensitive To River Discharges, Which Implies That The Water Development Project Plans Will Disturb The Lake Ecosystem If Implemented Up To 2021 And Integrated Watershed Management Plan For The Lake Can Change The Condition By Regulating The Dam Output. 2012 Ceers, Iau.

The Purpose Of The Study Was To Assess The Effects Of Elevated Salinity And Nutrient (Nitrogen And Phosphorus) Levels On Macro Invertebrate Abundance And Composition. A Total Of 32 Taxa Were Collected, And The Common Taxa, Including Chironomidae (Midges), Corixidae (Water Boatmen), Erythemis (Damselflies), Ephemerella (Mayflies), Hyalella (Amphipods), And Snails. Samples At Ponds With Salinities Greater Than 10 Ppt Showed A Shift In Community Composition To Salt-Tolerant Taxa And A Reduction In Total Diversity. The Corixid Trichocorixa Verticalis, The Brine Shrimp Artemia Partenogenetica, And The Dipteran Ephydra Are Salt-Tolerant Species That Only Occur At High Salinity Levels. Ponds Relatively High In Nutrients Had Fewer Total Taxa, Reduced Abundance And Diversity Of Aquatic Beetles, Lower Diversity Index Values, And A Greater Dominance By Chironomids Than Ponds Low In Nutrients. It Is Suggested To Allocate About 10 10 6 Cubic Meters Freshwater Of The Represented Rivers To These Wetlands To Improve Their Trophic Condition And Transfer Their Hypereutrophic Waters Into The Urmia Lake For More Production Of The Macro Invertebrates Both In The Wetlands And On The Lake.

For The Goals Of This Study Water Sampling And Analysis Where Performed In Two Wet And Dry Periods Of The Lake In Order To Represent The Extremes Of The Lake'S Environmental Variability. Prevailing Chemical Ions In The Water Body Were Determined And Used For The Estimation Of The Relative Thermodynamic Coefficients Of Salt Water For The Acquisition Of The Freezing Point, Boiling Point And The Vapor Pressure Of The Urmia Lake Water. Interpolated Calibration Curves Were Plotted For The Changes In The Studied Parameters Versus A Variety Of Salt Concentrations Indicating A Linear Relationship Between The Investigated Parameters And The Prevailing Salt Concentration Of The Urmia Lake. The Calibration Curves Were Then Formulated To Simplify The Estimation Of The Thermodynamic Parameters Of The Urmia Lake For Any Salinity Conditions.

In River Sediments, The Size Of P Pool Was Found To Be In The Order Of Ca-P &Gt, Res-P &Gt, Fe/Al-P &Gt, Exch-P Indicating Small Fraction Of Bioavailable P Pool And Ca-P Minerals Being The Most Dominant P Sink. Carbonate-Related Properties Had An Inverse Relationship With Bioavailable P Pools In The River Sediments Studied. The Principal Component Analysis (Pca) Of The Sequential Extraction Data With Sediment Properties Revealed That Four Principal Components Described 82.7% Of Total Variation. Similarly, Particle Size-Related Properties Were Found To Have The Highest Eigenvalues In The First Pc. Electron Diffraction Spectra (Eds) And X-Ray Fluorescence (Xrf) Analyses Showed A Largely Uniform Distribution Of P In The Upstream Sediment. However, Limited Evidence Of Local Enrichment Of P With Fe, Al, And Ca Contents Was Observed In The Downstream River Sediments. Correlation Of Fe/Al-P Pool Size With Al2O3 And Sio2 Contents Indicated That P Was Associated With Al Oxide And Clay Minerals In The Sediment Matrix. Overall, The Results From This Study Provide Insights Into The Variability Of Upstream And Downstream River Processes And Their Relationship With P Pools With Regard To Their Bioavailability. These Results Are Expected To Be Useful In Assessing The Potential Impact Of P Loading On The Aquatic Ecosystem In The Urmia Lake Basin. 2018, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Germany, Part Of Springer Nature.

Article	Arzanlou, M//Samadi, R//Frisvad, Jc//Houbraken, J//Ghosta, Y	Two Novel Aspergillus Species From Hypersaline Soils Of The National Park Of Lake Urmia, Iran	Mycological Progress	Two Novel Aspergillus Species, One Belonging To The Section Terrei And The Other To Section Flavipedes, Were Isolated From Hypersaline Soils Of The National Park Of Lake Urmia (Iran) And Are Here Described As Aspergillus Iranicus And Aspergillus Urmiensis. A Polyphasic Taxonomic Approach Comprising Extrolite Profiles, Phenotypic Characters And Molecular Data (Beta-Tubulin, Calmodulin And Ribosomal Polymerase Ii Second Largest Subunit Gene Sequences) Was Applied To Determine Their Novel Taxonomic Status. Aspergillus Iranicus (Cbs 139561T) Is Phylogenetically Related To A. Carneus, A. Niveus, A. Allahabadii And A. Neoindicus, And It Can Be Differentiated From Those Species By A Unique Extrolite Pattern (Citrinin, Gregatins, And A Terrequinone) And Its Conidial Colour. Aspergillus Urmiensis (Cbs 139558T) Shares A Most Recent Common Ancestor With A. Templicola. The Former Species Produces Globose Vesicles, And Those Of A. Templicola Are Predominantly Elongate. The Aspergillus Urmiensis Isolates Produce Several Uncharacterized Extrolites. Two Other Strains Obtained During This Study Reside In A Clade, Together With The Type Strain Of A. Movilensis (Ccf 4410T), And Are Identified Accordingly. Based On The Phylogenetic Data Presented In This Study, A. Frequens Is Reduced To Synonymy With A. Micronesiensis And A. Mangaliensis Is Considered To Be A Synonym Of A. Templicola. 2016, The Author(S).

It Is The Saltiest Large Lake In The World That Supports Life. Urmia Lake National Park Is The Home Of An Almost Endemic Crustacean Species Known As The Brine Shrimp, Artemia Urmiana. Other Forms Of Life Include Several Species Of Algae, Bacteria, Microfungi, Plants, Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians And Mammals. As A Consequence Of This Unique Biodiversity, This Lake Has Been Selected As One Of The 59 Biosphere Reserves By Unesco. This Paper Provides A Comprehensive Species Checklist That Needs To Be Updated By Additional Research In The Future. 2014 By The Authors.

For Example, Typically High Hatching Efficiency Is Possible Due To The Small Diameter Of Cysts (High Number Per Gram), Therefore Small Diameter Of Cysts Show Someway High Quality Of Cysts. This Study Was Performed During A Ten Year Period, Including Two Different Ecological Conditions: Rainy And Drought. It Is Important From Two Different Aspects Because It Covers Alteration Of A. Urmiana During Ten Years Also Its Variation In The Best And Worst Environmental Situations In Which Salinity Increased From 173.8 Ppt In 1994 To 280.8 Ppt In 2003/4. In This Study The Biometrical Raw Data Of Artemia Urmiana Cysts At Seven Stations From The Urmia Lake In 1994 And Their Seven Identical Locations At 26 Studied Stations In 2003/4 Were Reanalyzed Again And Compared Together. Biometrical Comparison Of Untreated And Decapsulated Cysts In Each Of The Seven Similar Stations Showed A Highly Significant Variation Between 1994 And 2003/4. Based On This Study, In Whole Stations The Untreated And Decapsulated Cysts From 1994 Were Larger Than Cysts Of 2003/4 Without Any Exception. But There Was No Logical Relationship Between Salinity And Chorion Thickness In The Urmia Lake. With Regard To Pca Analyses The Stations Of Two Different Studied Years Certainly Have Been Separated With Factor 1 From Each Other. In Conclusion, The Interaction Between Genetic And Environmental Factors Can Determine And Explain Variation In The Range Of Cysts Diameter In Artemia.

In This Study, In Addition To Trace Elements, Activity Concentration Of Natural (238U, 232Th And 40K) And Artificial (137Cs) Radioisotopes Are Determined In Soil And Sediment Specimens Collected From The Urmia Lake Shore By Adopting Gamma Ray Spectrometry Method. The Samples Are Analyzed For Trace Elements Including Heavy Metals Using Atomic Absorption And Icp-Ms Techniques. The Activity Concentration Levels Were Determined For 238U (From 8 To 48Bqkg1), 232Th (From 7 To 64Bqkg1), 40K (From Mda To 631Bqkg1) And 137Cs (From Mda To 22Bqkg1) With The Minimum Detectable Activity (Mda) Of 5, 4, 63 And 4Bqkg1, Respectively. It Seems That Except For The Cadmium, All Of The Elements Belong To Uncontaminated To Low Contaminated Soils Group. The Least Correlation Between 137Cs And Other Elements Distribution In The Area, Confirms Its Anthropogenic Man Made Source. Based On The Cluster And Factor Analysis Methods Of Data Processing, 238U, 232Th And 40K Belong To A Similar Group Which In Addition To Their Low Geo-Accumulation Indexes Can Point To Their Geogenic Sources, Related To Potassic Volcanic Rocks.

Soil And Root Samples Were Collected From Fields Cultivated With The Glycophytes Allium Cepa L. And Medicago Sativa L., And Sites Dominated By The Halophyte Salicornia Europaea L. Soil And Root Samples Were Analyzed For The Am Fungal Signature Neutral Lipid Fatty Acid (Nlfa) 16:15. The Roots Were Also Examined Microscopically For Mycorrhizal Colonization. Each Plant Species Was Sampled Across A Salt Gradient. Microscopic Examination Showed No Am Fungal Structures In The Roots Of S. Europaea. The Highest Root Colonization Was Recorded For M. Sativa. The Highest Nlfa 16:15 Values Were Found In Soil Around M. Sativa Roots And The Lowest In Soil Around S. Europaea Roots. We Found Evidence For Stimulation Of Vesicle Formation At Moderate Salinity Levels In M. Sativa, Which Is An Indication Of Increased Carbon Allocation To Mycorrhiza.

Recently, The Multivariate Nature Of Droughts Was Addressed Through Composite Indices Capable Of Including Different Factors Contributing To The Occurrence Of A Drought. However, Some Issues (Like The Autocorrelation Or The Proper Definition Of The Multivariate Index) Are Still Open And Need To Be Addressed To Make These Indices Applicable In Current Practice. Here, A Composite Agrometeorological Drought Index (Amdi-Sa) Has Been Introduced, Accounting For Meteorological And Agricultural Droughts, Considering Specifically Seasonality And Autocorrelation. The Amdi-Sa Combines, Through The Copula Concept And The Kendall Function, Two Drought Indices [Namely Multivariate Standardized Precipitation Index (Mspi) And The Multivariate Standardized Soil Moisture Index (Mssi)] In A Statistically Consistent (Normal Distributed) Drought Indicator. Nonparametric Distributions Have Been Used For The Variables Of Interest And The Calculation Of Mspi And Mssi, Whereas Parametric And Nonparametric (Empirical) Copulas Are Used To Build The Amdi-Sa. A Prewhitening Procedure Has Been Applied To The Mspi And Mssi To Remove The Autocorrelation. An Application To The Urmia Lake Basin In Iran Has Been Presented, Drought Indices Compared, And Their Spatial Variability Investigated. Results Showed That Mspi And Mssi Are Able To Justify 72 And 89% Of The Variability Throughout The Year. The Amdi-Sa Reflects The Combined Effect Of Soil Moisture And Precipitation, And Has A Behavior In Between Whitened Mspi And Mssi.

Eighteen Bread Wheat (Triticum Aestivum L.) Landraces From The West Area Of The Urmia Saline Lake Were Grown In A Greenhouse In The Department Of Plant Biology And Halophytes Biotechnology Center, Azarbaijan University Of Tarbiyat Moallem, Tabriz, Iran To Study The Effects Of Increasing Levels Of Sodium Chloride (Nacl) (Control, 75, And 150 Mm) On The Plant Leaves. The Experimental Design Was Factorial With A Randomized Complete Block With Three Replications. The Results Showed Salinity Caused An Obvious Decrease In Growth Of All Landraces. Physiological Parameters Such As Lipid Peroxidation, Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2) Content, And Cell Membrane Injury Increased With Increasing Salinity Levels With Different Degrees Among The Landraces. Salt Stress Increased The Sodium (Na+) Accumulation Coupled With A Decrease In Leaf Potassium (K+) Depending On Salinity Levels. The Analysis Of Variance Showed Significant Effects Of Salinity, Landraces And Their Interactions In All Studied Parameters. The Landraces Were Ranked For Salt Tolerance Indexes, And Cluster Group Ranking Ordered Landraces From Tolerant To Sensitive And Their Properties For Salt Stress Tolerance Are Open For Further Research.

It Is Located In Northwest Of Iran. Due To A Decrease In Water Inflow And Volume, The Salinity Of Urmia Lake Has Reached To More Than 300 G.L -1 Since 2001. The Increased Salinity Has Greatly Influenced Biological Aspects Of The Lake, And Caused The Lake Undergoes At Critical Conduction. The Aim Of The Present Study Was To Investigate The Distribution Fluctuations Of Phytoplanktons And Selected Physicochemical Factors In Relation To Artemia Distribution In Urmia Lake During 8 Months. Statistical Analysis Of Mean Values Of Ion Concentrations And Phytoplankton Abundance Indicated Significant Differences Among Sampling Months. The Minimum And Maximum Values For The Selected Factors Were, As Cl - 176.2-201.3 G.L -1, Co 2 95-175Mg.L -1, Dissolved Oxygen (Do) 0.1-2.8 Mg.L -1, Hco - 3 144-496 Mg.L -11, Po 2+ 4 104-875 Mg.L -1, No - 3 330-4104 Mg.L -1, No - 2 4-21.5 Mg.L -1, So 2- 4 10490-29840 Mg.L -1, Ca 2+ 561-1606 Mg.L -1, Mg 2+ 3649-14587 Mg.L -1 While Water Hardness Was 21000- 62000 Mg.L -1.

Since Evaporation Level Variations Of Lakes Have A Dynamic Identity, Chaos Theory Can Have A Unique Role In Collecting Data Of These Variations. Therefore It Is An Important And Challenging Problem In The Field Of Planning And Qualitative And Quantitative Management Of Urmia Lake To Verify Whether The Evaporation Time Series Are Stochastic Or Chaotic That Is Discussed In The Present Study. In Addition To Introduction Of Different Utilities Of Chaos Theory, The Monthly Evaporation Amounts Of Urmia Lake In The Past 40 Years Have Been Studied And Predicted In The Present Research. So After Calculating The Delay Time (T=7.5) By Using Average Mutual Information Method (Ami) And Embedding Dimension (D=3) By Using False Nearest Neighbor Algorithm (Fnn), The Slope Of Correlation Dimension Diagram Has Been Computed. The Non-Integer Amount Of The Slope (2.47) Represents That The System Is Chaotic. Lyapunov Exponent And Broad Band In Fourier Power Spectrum Are Other Indexes Reported In The Present Study And Their Provided Results Ensures That The System Is Chaotic. Thus The Amount Of Urmia Lake Evaporation Is Predictable. Therefore The Amount Of Evaporation In The Recent 10 Years (1997-2007) Have Been Predicted By Means Of False Nearest Neighbor Algorithm And Verified With The Observed Data. The Results Agree With The High Accuracy Of Chaos Theory Predictions So The Amount Of Evaporation Of The Lake Is Predicted For 10 Following Years (2007-2017).

Nonlinear Approaches Such As Threshold Time Series And Conditional Heteroscedasticity Models Are Still Seldom Used. In This Study, First, Two- And Three-Regime Self-Exciting Threshold Autoregressive (Setar) Models Are Used To Model The Mean Behavior Of Daily Streamflows. The Residual Time Series Computed From The Difference Between Observations And Lag-One Time-Ahead Best-Estimates Of The Fitted Models Are Also Obtained. Second, The Conditional Variance Behavior Of The Residual Series Obtained From The Two- And Three-Regime Setar Models Is Modeled Using The Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (Garch) Model. The Garch Model Is Hence Used To Capture The Time-Varying Variance Behavior Of Residuals As A Nonlinear Phenomenon And Thus It Removes The Existence Of Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity So-Called Arch Effect. Finally, The Performance Of Setar Models And Their Combination With The Garch Model Are Evaluated. Six Deseasonalized Daily Streamflow Series From Upstream Watershed Rivers Of Zarrineh Rood Dam, In The Southern Part Of Lake Urmia In Iran, Are Used To Illustrate And Test The Procedure. The Mcleod-Li Test, A Formal Test For Demonstrating The Arch Effect, Indicates That The Arch Effect Exists In All Residual Series, Which Means That The Residuals Of Streamflow Time Series Are Nonstationary In Terms Of The Variance. Results Indicate That The Hybrid Setar-Garch Models Performed Better Than The Models Without Garch Component. Results Demonstrate Also That The Use Of Nonlinear Setar And Garch Improves Streamflow Modeling Efficiency By Capturing The Heteroscedasticity In The Residuals Of Nonlinear Threshold Time Series. 2019	Daily Streamflows, Garch Model, Lake Urmia, Nonlinearity, Two- And Three-Regime Setar Models, Arches, Lakes, Time Series, Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity, Conditional Heteroscedasticity, Garch Models, Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity, Lake Urmia, Linear Time Series Model, Nonlinearity, Setar Model, Stream Flow, Hydrological Modeling, Nonlinearity, Streamflow, Three-Dimensional Modeling, Two-Dimensional Modeling, Watershed, Iran, Lake Urmia, Zarrineh River	10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2019.03.072	82-97	Scopus	573	2019

To Improve The Understanding Of Regional Differences In Water Availability Throughout The Region And To Refine The Existing Information On Precipitation Variability, This Study Investigated The Spatial Pattern Of Precipitation For The Lake Urmia Basin. Daily Rainfall Time Series From 122 Precipitation Stations With Different Record Lengths Were Used To Extract 15 Statistical Descriptors Comprising 25Th Percentile, 75Th Percentile, And Coefficient Of Variation For Annual And Seasonal Total Precipitation. Principal Component Analysis In Association With Cluster Analysis Identified Three Main Homogeneous Precipitation Groups In The Lake Basin. The First Sub-Region (Group 1) Includes Stations Located In The Center And Southeast, The Second Sub-Region (Group 2) Covers Mostly Northern And Northeastern Part Of The Basin, And The Third Sub-Region (Group 3) Covers The Western And Southern Edges Of The Basin. Results Of Principal Component (Pc) And Clustering Analyses Showed That Seasonal Precipitation Variation Is The Most Important Feature Controlling The Spatial Pattern Of Precipitation In The Lake Basin. The 25Th And 75Th Percentiles Of Winter And Autumn Are The Most Important Variables Controlling The Spatial Pattern Of The First Rotated Principal Component Explaining About 32% Of The Total Variance. Summer And Spring Precipitation Variations Are The Most Important Variables In The Second And Third Rotated Principal Components, Respectively. Seasonal Variation In Precipitation Amount And Seasonality Are Explained By Topography And Influenced By The Lake And Westerly Winds That Are Related To The Strength Of The North Atlantic Oscillation.

Article	Habibi, E//Lak, R//Torabi, H//Mahmoudi, S//Momtaz, H	Investigating The Relationships Between Chemical Indices Of Soil Development And Weathering In Various Parent Materials In Urmia Lake Catchment	Carpathian Journal Of Earth And Environmental Sciences	According To Recent Environmental Crisis And Drying Of Urmia Lake That Affecting Surrounding Lands, This Study Was Conducted To Evaluate The Physico-Chemical Properties, Weathering Rates And Evolution Of Soils By Using Various Weathering Indices And Forms Of Iron In Miandoab Township. Thirteen Soil Profiles Were Described On Different Parent Material. The Results Showed That The Studied Soils Were In The Orders Of Inceptisols And Entisols And The Difference In The Type Of Parent Material, Physiography And Aspect Were Effective On The Soil Physicochemical Characteristics. Also The Results In The Iron Part Showed That A Significant Portion Of The Iron Is In Crystalline Form. Considering The High Correlation Between The Two Factors Of Weathering Intensity And Iron Mobility Index, Profiles 3, 2, 8, 7 And 10 Had Higher Evolution Rates With Respect To Other Profiles. The Geochemical Result Showed That The Geology And Composition Of The Soil Parent Materials Had Largely Affected The Amount Of Chemical Weathering. The Negative Correlation Between Na 2 O, Cao And K 2 O And Chemical Index Of Alternation Indicates Weathering Of The Plagioclases And Feldspars In This Area. Also Weathering Indices Where The Ratio Of Immobile Element To The Mobile Oxides Is Incorporated In Their Formula Were More Appropriate For Estimating The Weathering Intensity. 2019 Carpathian Journal Of Earth And Environmental Sciences.

The Goal Of The Study Was To Properly Account For Field Measured Soil Electrical Conductivity (Ec) As Soft Data For The Spatial Prediction Of Soil Salinity. Samplings Were Done In Autumn 2009 (First Dataset), Spring And Autumn 2010 (Second And Third Datasets) Around Uromieh Lake, Northwest Of Iran. The Salinity Was Measured Both In The Field And Laboratory For The First And Second Datasets. The First Dataset Was Used For Error Measurements From Which An Error Variance Can Be Estimated. The Measured Errors Were Then Used For Characterizing Probabilistic Type Soft Data Using The Second Dataset. The Kme With Only Soft Data (Skme), Kme With Both Soft And Hard Data (Hskme) And Ordinary Kriging Methods Were Compared. Validation Criteria, Mean Error (Me) And Mean Squared Error (Mse) Were Used For Comparing The Methods. Finally, The Skme Method Was Applied As A Way Of Improving The Salinity Prediction For The Third Dataset Where Only Field Measured Soil Salinity Data Were Available. Comparing Different Kriging Methods, Ordinary Kriging (Ok) Showed The Best Results Among The Comparing Methods With Me And Mse Equal To -0.12 And 0.55 Respectively. Skme With Me Equal To -0.13 Was Slightly Different From Ok And Skme With Me Equal To -0.24 Resulted In More Bias Predictions Among Others.

To Develop And Apply Any Plans To Survive The Lake, Qualitative And Quantitative Analysis And Any Modeling, Deriving Physical Information Such As Volume, Area And Their Changes Are Very Crucial. The Objectives Of This Study Were Therefore, Intended Firstly, To Study The Bathymetry Of Urmia Lake With A More Satisfactory Approach Using Landsat- Ldcm Satellite Image And In Situ Measurement Data. The Polynomial Model Was Developed To Predict The Water Depth In Urmia Lake Area. This Model Was Developed With The Input Series Of Reflectance Values From Blue, Green, Red And Nir Bands In The Landsat- Ldcm Satellite Imagery For Urmia Lake Taken On 12 April 2013 Of The Sampling Sites From Actual Depth Measured Were Taken On The Same Date. Also, Using A Large Archive Of Landsat Imagery (Tm, Etm+ And Ldcm), A Counter Of Equivalent Elevation Were Established For Deriving The Bathymetry Of Desiccated Areas By Mapping The Edges Of The Lake And Finally Assembled With Bathymetry Derived From Polynomial Model. In-Situ Depth Measurements Were Used To Evaluate Resultant Derived Bathymetric Map. This Comparison Shows Reasonable Agreement Between The Landsat-Derived Depths And Those Measured In The Field With Rmse Of 0.27Cm And R2=0.91. The Maximum And Mean Depths Measured Were 4.9 And 11M Respectively. The Maximum Depth Measured Was Located At The Upper Part Of The Lake. As Well As, Developed Multi-Regression Equation Used For Deriving Another Bathymetry Map Using Landsat- Ldcm Satellite Image Taken On Sep. 2015 For Salt Deposition Monitoring. Results Indicates That About 64Cm Salt Deposition Has Occurred During The Last Two Years. Secondly, To Make Stage Curves Of Lake, Multi-Temporal Changes Of Water Body Have Been Derived From Landsat, Modis And Avhrr Satellite Images Sets Since 1972. In This Regard, The Area Of Urmia Lake At Different Level Was Estimated Base On Object Oriented And Pixel Base Classification Using 78 Satellite Images.

In Recent Decades, The Drop In Water Level Of The Lake Has Been One Of The Most Important Environmental Issues In Iran. At Present, The Entire Basin Is Threatened Due To Abrupt Decline Of The Lakes Water Level And The Consequent Increase In Salinity. Despite The Numerous Studies, There Is Still An Ambiguity About The Main Cause Of This Environmental Crisis. This Paper Is An Attempt To Detect The Changes In The Landscape Structure Of The Main Elements Of The Whole Basin Using Remote Sensing Techniques And Analyze The Results Against Climate Data With Time Series Analysis For The Purpose Of Achieving A More Clarified Illustration Of Processes And Trends. Trend Analysis Of The Different Affecting Factors Indicates That The Main Cause Of The Drastic Dry Out Of The Lake Is The Huge Expansion Of Irrigated Agriculture In The Basin Between 1999 And 2014. The Climatological Parameters Including Precipitation And Temperature Cannot Be The Main Reasons For Reduced Water Level In The Lake. The Results Show How The Increase In Irrigated Agricultural Area Without Considering The Water Resources Limits Can Lead To A Regional Disaster. The Approach Used In This Study Can Be A Useful Tool To Monitor And Assess The Causality Of Environmental Disaster. 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

Data Of Ten Climate Models Among The Atmosphere Ocean General Circulation Models (Aogcms) Were Assembled For The 2021-2050 Period Under A2 And B1 Emission Scenarios. First, Both The 30-Year Historic (1961-1990) And 30-Year Future Monthly Temperature And Precipitation In The Region Were Generated And Weighted By The Beta Function () That Assigns Weights To Aogcms Based On The Model Evaluations. Then, The Cumulative Density Function (Cdf) In Each Month Was Determined. Precipitation And Temperature Values At 25, 50, And 75% Probability Were Extracted From The Cdfs. Subsequently These Values Were Introduced To The Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator Model (Lars-Wg) To Downscale And Produce Time Series Of Temperature And Precipitation In The Future, Subject To The Uncertainty Of Climate Models. Then, These Monthly Time Series At Different Risk Levels Were Introduced Into The Artificial Neural Network (Ann) Model And Future Monthly Runoff Time Series Were Generated. The Findings Indicated A Decrease In The Flow Into The Lake Of The Order Of 21, 13, And 0.3% Under The A2 Scenario And An Increase Of 4.7, 13.8, And 18.9% Under The B2 Scenario With Respect To The Observation Period At 25, 50, And 75% Risk Levels, Respectively. The Results Of This Study Highlight The Necessity To Immediately And Effectively Cut Back On The Water Use In The Basin Not Only To Remedy The Projected Climate Change Effects In The Future, But Also To Ensure Gradual Reclamation Of The Ongoing Environmental Crisis. 2016 American Society Of Civil Engineers.

While Many High-Efficient Solar Collectors Are Developed For This Objective, It Is Discovered That Solar Pond With Big Size Can Be More Cost-Effective Than Many Types Of High-Efficient Collectors. In Pursuance Of This Objective, Plausibility Of Extracting Thermal Heat From A Salinity-Gradient Solar Pond (Sgsp) Set-Up For Water Distillation Via A Humidification-Dehumidification (Hdh) System Is Scrutinized Under Privilege Of Thermodynamics Laws. Furthermore, Due To The Fact That Solar Pond'S Pumps Consume More Power For Their Task, Two Thermoelectric Generators (Tges) Are Posited To Use Waste Heat Of The Discarded Brine And Distilled Water To Generate Electricity For Power Demands. Single-Criterion Optimization Is Executed For The Suggested Set-Up And The Results Are Presented For The Urmia Lake In Iran. Considering Maximization Of Distilled Water Scenario, The Findings Outlined That 4.5 M 3 /H Distilled Water And 3.16 Kw Net Electricity Can Be Generated With Cogeneration Gain-Output-Ratio (Cgor) Of 1.56 And Exergy-Based Cgor (Ecgor) Of 4.87%. Also, The Designed Desalination Unit Generated More Fresh Water Between 22 May And 22 July For Urmia Province, While More Electricity Is Generated Between 21 April And 21 May. Among All Constituents Of The Introduced Sgsp/Hdh System, Dehumidifier Attributed As The Major Site Of Loss By Exergy Destruction Of 15.23 Kw. At Last, An Exhaustive Parametric Evaluation Is Established To Scrutinize Impact Of Some Preeminent Design Parameters On The Targets. It Is Exhibited That The Cgor Can Be Maximized With Desalination Flow Ratio, While The Ecgor Can Be Maximized With Lower-Convective Zone Temperature. 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Article	Shadkam, S//Ludwig, F//Van, Oel, P//Kirmit//Kabat, P	Impacts Of Climate Change And Water Resources Development On The Declining Inflow Into Iran'S Urmia Lake	Journal Of Great Lakes Research	Urmia Lake, The World'S Second Largest Hypersaline Lake, Has Decreased In Size Over Recent Decades Primarily Because Inflow Has Diminished. This Has Caused Serious Socio-Environmental Consequences Similar To Those Of The Aral Sea Disaster. By Using The Variable Infiltration Capacity (Vic) Model, This Study Estimates The Relative Contributions Of Climate Change And Water Resources Development, Which Includes The Construction Of Reservoirs And Expansion Of Irrigated Areas, To Changes In Urmia Lake Inflow Over The Period 19602010. The Model Results Show That Decreases In Inflow Generally Follow Observed Decreases In Precipitation, Although The Variability In Inflow Is More Pronounced Than The Variability In Precipitation. The Results Also Suggest That Water Use For Irrigation Has Increased Pressure On The Basin'S Water Availability And Has Caused Flows To Decrease By As Much As 40% During Dry Years. On The Other Hand, The Presence Of Reservoirs Positively Contributed To Water Availability During Relatively Dry Years And Did Not Significantly Reduce Lake Inflow. By Accelerating Irrigation Expansion In The Basin, Reservoirs Have, However Indirectly, Contributed To Inflow Reduction. Our Results Show That Annual Inflow To Urmia Lake Has Dropped By 48% Over The Study Period. About Three Fifths Of This Change Was Caused By Climate Change And About Two Fifths Was Caused By Water Resource Development. The Results Of This Study Show That, To Prevent Further Desiccation Of Urmia Lake, It Will Be Necessary Both To Develop National Plans To Reduce Irrigation Water Use And To Develop International Plans To Address Climate Change. 2016 International Association For Great Lakes Research.

Article	Shadkam, S//Ludwig, F//Van, Vliet, Mth//Pastor, A//Kabat, P	Preserving The World Second Largest Hypersaline Lake Under Future Irrigation And Climate Change	Science Of The Total Environment	Iran Urmia Lake, The World Second Largest Hypersaline Lake, Has Been Largely Desiccated Over The Last Two Decades Resulting In Socio-Environmental Consequences Similar Or Even Larger Than The Aral Sea Disaster. To Rescue The Lake A New Water Management Plan Has Been Proposed, A Rapid 40% Decline In Irrigation Water Use Replacing A Former Plan Which Intended To Develop Reservoirs And Irrigation. However, None Of These Water Management Plans, Which Have Large Socio-Economic Impacts, Have Been Assessed Under Future Changes In Climate And Water Availability. By Adapting A Method Of Environmental Flow Requirements (Efrs) For Hypersaline Lakes, We Estimated Annually 3.7109 M3 Water Is Needed To Preserve Urmia Lake. Then, The Variable Infiltration Capacity (Vic) Hydrological Model Was Forced With Bias-Corrected Climate Model Outputs For Both The Lowest (Rcp2.6) And Highest (Rcp8.5) Greenhouse-Gas Concentration Scenarios To Estimate Future Water Availability And Impacts Of Water Management Strategies. Results Showed A 10% Decline In Future Water Availability In The Basin Under Rcp2.6 And 27% Under Rcp8.5. Our Results Showed That If Future Climate Change Is Highly Limited (Rcp2.6) Inflow Can Be Just Enough To Meet The Efrs By Implementing The Reduction Irrigation Plan. However, Under More Rapid Climate Change Scenario (Rcp8.5) Reducing Irrigation Water Use Will Not Be Enough To Save The Lake And More Drastic Measures Are Needed. Our Results Showed That Future Water Management Plans Are Not Robust Under Climate Change In This Region. Therefore, An Integrated Approach Of Future Land-Water Use Planning And Climate Change Adaptation Is Therefore Needed To Improve Future Water Security And To Reduce The Desiccating Of This Hypersaline Lake. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Early Pedogenesis Crystalline Iron Oxide Is One Of The Most Important Diagnostic Criteria To Monitor The Aforementioned Process. In This Study, The East Shore Of The Shrinking Urmia Lake Located In The North West Of Iran Was Selected For Investigation. This Article Aims To Express The Importance Of Advanced Digital Soil Mapping To Link Between A Difficult-To-Measure Soil Attribute (I.E. Crystalline Iron Oxides) And Remotely Sensed Data As Easy-To-Measure Variables. Additionally, The Spatial Distribution Of Clay And Soil Total Iron Density Was Also Assessed. In This Article, Both Landsat 8 And Landsat 7 Imagery Were Acquired For July 2017 And 1999 Respectively. Eighteen Remotely Sensed Data (Environmental Covariates) Were Employed For Analysis, And A Bootstrapping Method Was Used To Analyze The Associated Uncertainty Of The Created Maps. Three Data Mining Techniques Namely, Multiple Linear Regression, Decision Tree Modeling And Cubist Modeling Were Candidate Models For Mapping The Target Variables Across The Study Area. Regarding Optimality, A Multiple Linear Regression Model Was Fitted To Predict Clay Content, While A Cubist Model Was Fitted To Predict Both Soil Total Iron Density (Sfed) And Crystalline Iron Oxide (Fecrys). From The Summary Output, Spectral Bands In The Visible Region Did Not Predict Sfed As Strongly As That Found For Fecrys. As We Expected, Fecrys Content Increases With Increasing The Distance From The Shore. This Means That The Ripened Soils Have Been Established Far From The Water Body. 2018	Data Mining, Digital Soil Mapping, Modeling, Pedogenesis, Soil Ripening, Crystalline Materials, Data Mining, Decision Trees, Forecasting, Lakes, Linear Regression, Mapping, Models, Remote Sensing, Soil Surveys, Soils, Trees (Mathematics), Uncertainty Analysis, Bootstrapping Method, Decision Tree Modeling, Digital Soil Mappings, Multiple Linear Regression Models, Multiple Linear Regressions, Pedogenesis, Remotely Sensed Data, Spatial Variability, Iron Oxides, Bootstrapping, Data Mining, Digital Map, Iron Oxide, Landsat, Mapping Method, Modeling, Pedogenesis, Satellite Data, Satellite Imagery, Spatial Distribution, Spatial Variation, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1016/J.GEODERMA.2018.11.024	1196-1207	Scopus	337	2019

In This Paper, We Provide Our Geological Observations Made Along The Maragheh And Salmas Strike-Slip Fault Zones That Affect The Southern Portion Of Northwest Iran To The South Of The North Tabriz Fault. We Use A Combined Methodology To Characterize Active Faulting Along These Fault Zones That Included Remote-Sensing Analysis Of High-Resolution Satellite Imagery And Aerial Photographs, Digital Elevation Models (Dems), Tectonic Geomorphology Investigations And Geological Field Surveys. Active Transtension Is A Common Feature Along The Maragheh And Salmas Faults, And Our Observations Suggested That The Onset Of Active Transtension And Related Local Extension Along The Faults In Pleistocene Occurred No Earlier Than ~2 Ma.

Due To The Fact That Recent Droughts Have Put A Lot Of Pressure On Water Supply Systems, Drought Management Have A Particular Importance. For This Purpose, Monitoring And Forecasting Systems Can Be Considered As Appropriate Tools. In This Research, Monitoring And Prediction Of Drought In The Urmia Synoptic Station In Short-, Medium-, And Long-Term Timescales Were Investigated Using The Spei (Standardized Precipitation And Evapotranspiration Drought Index) And Gene Expression Programming Model. For This Purpose, The Spei Was Calculated For Timescales 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, And 48Months With Using Monthly Rainfall And Temperature Data From 1951 To 2009, And Its Performance Was Compared With Standard Precipitation Index (Spi). The Results Showed That The Correlation Coefficient Of Spei And Spi In The 3-, 12-, And 48-Month Timescales Were 0.84, 0.845, And 0.776, Respectively. The Monitoring Results Showed Two Long Periods Of Drought-Related Years 19591967 And 19982009 During The Statistical Period. After Drought Monitoring Based On Spei Time Series, Drought Was Predicted Using Gene Expression Programming Models With Delays Of 1 To 5Months. According To The Results, The Prediction Accuracy Was Increased By Increasing The Scale Of Spei So That The Correlation Coefficient In The Test Stage In The One-Month Scale (Spei1) Increased From 0.215 To 0.984 In 48-Month Scale (Spei48) And The Overall Accuracy Of The Model Increased From 60.1 In Spei1 To 92.3% In Spei48. 2019, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Austria, Part Of Springer Nature.

Shores Are Special Zones That Are In Contact With Three Atmosphere, Hydrosphere And Lithosphere Environments Of Earth. Shore Lines Are Of The Most Important Linear Features Of The Earth'S Surface Which Have An Animated And Alive Nature. In This Regard, Optimized Management Of The Shores And Environmental Protection For Stable Development Require Observing The Shorelines And Their Variations. Protection Of Shorelines Within Appropriate Time Periods Is Of High Importance For The Purpose Of Optimized Management Of The Shores. The Twenty First Century Has Been Called The Era Of Information Explosion. A Time That, Through Benefits Of New Technologies, Information Experts Attempt To Generate More And Up To Date Information In Various Fields And To Provide Them For Managers And Decision Makers In Order To Be Considered For Future Planning And Also To Assist The Planners To Arrange And Set A Comprehensive Plan. Aerial Images And Remote Sensing Technology Are Economic Methods To Acquire The Required Data. Such Methods Are Free From Common Time And Place Limitations In Survey Based Methods. Among Remote Sensing Data, The Ones Acquired From Optical Images Have Several Benefits Which Include Low Cost, Interpretation Simplicity And Ease Of Access. That Is Why Most Of The Researches Concerning Extraction Of Shorelines Are Practiced Using Optical Images. On The Other Hand, Wide Range Coverage Of Satellite Images Along With Rapid Access To Them Caused These Images To Be Used Extensively For Extracting The Shorelines. The Attempt In This Research Is To Use Satellite Images And Their Application In Order To Study Variations Of The Shorelines. Thus, For This Purpose, Landsat Satellite Images From Tm And Etm+ Sensors In The 35 Time Period Has Been Used. In Order To Reach Better Results, Images From Modis Satellite Has Been Used As Auxiliary Data For The Images That Are With An Error Margin. Initial Classification On The Images Was Conducted To Distinguish Water And Non Water Applications. Neural Network Classification Was Applied With Specific Scales On The Images And The Two Major Applications Were Thereby Extracted. Then, In Order To Authenticate The Proceedings, Error Matrix And Kappa Coefficient Has Been Applied On The Classified Images. Base Pixel Method Of Neural Network Was Used For The Purpose Of Information Extraction While Authenticity Of That Was Evaluated Too. The Outcomes Display The Trend Of Urmia Shoreline Has Been Approximately Constant Between The Years Of 1976 To 1995 And Has Experienced Very Low Variations. In 1998 The Lake Experienced Increase Of Water And Therefore Advancement Of The Shoreline Of The Lake Due To Increase Of Precipitation And The Volume Of Inflowing Water To The Basin. During 2000 To 20125, However, The Lake'S Shoreline Has Experienced A Downward Trend, Which Was Intensified In 2007 And Reached To Its Most Critical Level Ever Since, That Is Decreasing To About One Third. Further, Temporal And Spatial Potentiality Evaluation Of Clouds Seeding In Urmia Lake Zone Has Been Studied As A Solution For Improvement And Recovery Of The Current Status Of The Lake, And An Algorithm Was Proposed For Optimized Temporal- Spatial Study On Could Seeding. Ecological, Meteorological And Synoptic Data Were Used For Timing Study Of The Cloud'S Seeding Plan, Which Upon Study, It Is Easy To Evaluate Precipitation Potential And Quality Of The System. At The Next Step, The Rate Of Humidity And Also Stability Of The Precipitating System Can Be Analyzed Using Radar Acquired Data. Whereas Extracted Date From Modis Images Are Expressing The Spatial Position, Therefore In Order To Study The Location Of The Cloud'S Seeding, Modis Images Of The Selected Time Intervals Along With Applying Mcm Algorithm Were Used To Conclude Thick Clouds. Also, With Interpolation Of The Trmm Data, It Is Possible To Deduce Maximum Precipitation In The Form Of Spatial Arena. One Of The Data Categories That Is Used Both For Temporal And Spatial Analysis Is Radar Images Which In Addition To Time, Displays The Existing Humidity Range, Movement Direction, And Positions Of Accumulated Precipitation Cores. Therefore, Using This Algorithm, It Is Possible To Conclude The Most Optimized Spatial Position In Order To Execute The Seeding Plan.

Urmia Lake, As A Hyper Saline And Very Shallow Lake, Located In The Northwest Of Iran, Has Water Level Reductions Of About 40 Cm Each Year Over The Past Two Decades. In This Research, The Indices Of Environmental And Agricultural Sustainability Are Evaluated Using Performance Criteria Influenced By Climate Change And Water Management Strategies For The Zarrinehrud And Siminehrud River Basins As The Largest Sub-Basin Of Urmia Lake Basin. Modeling Of Hydrologic Behavior Of These Basins Is Performed Using Weap21 Model. The Model Is Analyzed For Three Future Emission Scenarios (A2, A1B, And B1), For The Period Of 2015-2040 And Five Water Management Scenarios: (1) Keeping The Existing Situation, (2) Crop Pattern Change, (3) Improving The Conveyance And Distribution Efficiency, (4) Combining The Improvement Of Conveyance And Distribution Efficiency With Improving The Application Efficiency Using Modern Technology, And (5) The Combination Of Crop Pattern Change With The Improvement Of Total Irrigation Efficiency. The Results Show That The Highest Values Of Indices Of Environmental Sustainability And Agricultural Sustainability Are Related To The Scenario Of Combining The Crop Pattern Change With Improving The Total Irrigation Efficiency Under The B1 Emission Scenario (B1S4). 2018 By The Authors.

Aral Sea In Asia, Lake Chad In Africa, Lake Mead In Usa, Lake Urmia In Iran, Etc. These Ecosystems Play An Important Role In Social, Ecological, And Economic Activities. Lake Urmia, Recognized As An International Wetland In 1973 And Located In Iran, Which Is The Second Largest Hypersaline Lake In The World, Is In The Same State. Lake Urmia Biologically And Ecologically Is One Of The Most Interesting Places In The World. This Lake Is A Habitat For Various Species. The Lake'S Surface Has Shrunken From 6000 Km2 To 900 Km2 In 2013. The Statistics Indicate That The Population Has Increased By 13% During This Period, Which Shows That In Addition To Natural Causes Such As Climate Change And Global Warming, Human Related Issues Like Population Growth And Urban Development Have The Most Important Role In The Lake'S Status.

Presently, Due To Some Natural And Anthropogenic Implications On Earth, Newly-Born Sand Dunes Are Quickly Emerging. Lake Urmia, The World'S Second Largest Permanent Hypersaline Lake, Has Started Shrinking, Vast Lands Comprising Sand Dunes Over The Western Shore Of The Lake Have Appeared And One Question Has Been Playing On The Minds Of Nearby Dwellers: Where Are These Sand Dunes Coming From, What There Was Not 15 Years Ago!! In The Present Study, The Determination Of The Source Of The Lake Urmia Sand Dunes In Terms Of The Quantifying Relative Contribution Of Each Upstream Geomorphological/Lithological Unit Has Been Performed Using Geochemical Fingerprinting Techniques. The Findings Demonstrate That The Alluvial And The Fluvial Sediments Of The Western Upstream Catchment Have Been Transported By Water Erosion And They Accumulated In The Lower Reaches Of The Kahriz River. Wind Erosion, As A Secondary Agent, Have Carried The Aeolian Sand-Sized Sediments To The Sand Dune Area. Hence, The Lake Urmia Sand Dunes Have Been Originating From Simultaneous And Joint Actions Of Alluvial, Fluvial And Aeolian Processes. 2017 The Author(S).

Article	Ahmadzadeh, H//Morid, S//Delavar, M//Srinivasan, R	Using The Swat Model To Assess The Impacts Of Changing Irrigation From Surface To Pressurized Systems On Water Productivity And Water Saving In The Zarrineh Rud Catchment	Agricultural Water Management	Considering Global Water Scarcity, Especially In The Agricultural Sector, Many Attempts Are Being Made To Improve Water Productivity And Save More Water. Changing Irrigation Systems From Surface To Pressurized Has Been One Of The Considerable Actions In This Regard. However, Any Attempts To Do So Must Be Evaluated In An Integrated Perspective At The Basin Level By Means Of Relevant Agro-Hydrological Models Before Making Them Operational. This Paper Aims To Address This Issue By Using The Soil And Water Assessment Tool (Swat). Zarrineh Rud River, The Main Feeding River Of Northwest Iran'S Lake Urmia, Is Selected As The Case Study For Exploring This Methodology. This Lake Has Been Shrinking Since 1995, And To Save Water And Increase The Basin'S Water Productivity, Improvement Of Pressurized Systems Is Considered As A Solution. Swat Cannot Directly Simulate Changing The Irrigation System From Surface To Pressurized. In This Study, We Use The Innovative Approach Of Applying The Model To Simulate Different Irrigation Systems Considering Real Irrigation Management Variables Such As Depth And Date Of Each Irrigation Event. Also, In Order To Improve Its Performance In Simulation Of Such Systems, A Comprehensive Calibration Procedure Was Used Based On A Wide Range Of Data For Hydrological And Agricultural Variables. The Results Showed That Changing The Current Irrigation To A Pressurized System Can Increase Water Productivity Up To 15% Due To Increases In Crop Yield, Better Water Distribution And Greater Actual Evapotranspiration. However, Pressurized Irrigation Results In No Significant Change In Total Inflow To The Lake. Notably, These Systems Can Intensify Drawdown Of The Basin'S Water Table Up To 20%. So, Any Significant Real Water Saving Program In The Basin Must Be Associated With Reduction Of Evapotranspiration By Adopting Measures Like Reducing Cultivated Areas, Changing Cropping Patterns To Less Water Consuming Plants, Or Applying Deficit Irrigation. The Applied Methodology Of This Paper As Well As The Comprehensive Calibration And Setup Of The Swat Model With The Readily Available Hydrological And Agricultural Variables Can Be A Good Sample For Similar Works. However, Further Work Is Still Needed To More Broadly Test This Approach In Areas With Intensive Irrigation Systems. 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Article	Alemohammad, S//Yavari, Ar//Salehi, S//Zebardast, L	Using The Strategic Environmental Assessment For Compilation Polices Of Sustainable Development Plan In Lake Urmia	Journal Of Environmental Studies	Introduction: Average Per-Capita Renewable Water Of Iran Is Decreasing Strongly. In Near Future Water Wars In The Middle East Are Predictable. Exploitation Of Land Resource Has The Most Significant Impact On Wetlands. Wetlands Degradation Is The Serious Warning To Unsustainable Development. Despite That The Lake Urmia Is Recorded In Conservation Lists As Iranian National Parks, Ramsar Sites And Unesco Biosphere Reserves, Over The Past Decade, Change Detection In This Land Indicates The Regression Of Water Level. Geology Studies Such As Sediment, Pale Limnology And Hydro Geochemistry Have Shown The Role Of Climate In Drying Of Urmia Lake With Serious Uncertainty. Testimonies Indicate That Urmia Lake During The Holocene Wasn'T Dry Except In Shoreline. Unsustainable Future For Environmental And Socio-Economic Dimensions Of This Land Is Predictable. Thus, Investigation About The Ways Of Utilization Water Resources In Basic Needs (Especially Water And Soil) In Urmia Watershed Seems Necessary. In Macroscopic And Coarse Scales, Sustainable Development Policy Making Needs Strategic Environmental Assessment (Sea) Approach. Integrated Management Plan For Watershed Of Lake Urmia Is Single Plan In Urmia Basin Scale. This Plan Doesn'T Have Necessary Strategies For Resource Management And Has A Lot Of Ambiguities And Faults. Moreover, Resource Management Of This Land Didn'T Have Requisite Strategies. This Study Will Identify Causal Chains Of Land Degradation With Driving Force-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (Dpsir) Model. Then, Policies Are Collected In Order To Protect Natural Resources, The Area, And The Profits Of Local Residual And Future Generations With Sea Approach. Sea Studies Have Just Begun In Iran, So This Study Has Much Educational And Investigative Value. Materials And Methods: Urmia Lake Is Located At The End Of Closed Endorheic Basin Of Urmia In North West Iranian Plateau. This Basin Has Nine Watersheds. Two Watersheds Are Situated On Ecological Zone. This Study Is Based On Description And Systematic Analysis By Using Quantitative And Qualitative Data In Sea Framework And Policy Making Category. Screening And Scoping Stages Are Noted To Understand State Of Environment And Completion Of Socio-Economic Baseline Studies. Screening Stage Is Noted To Initial Environmental Evaluation By Using Dpsir Model. This Model Defines The Association Between Environmental Processes And Environmental Impact With Human Activities. In Scoping Stage, Important Scales, Variable Ecological Components, And Variable Social Components Have Been Distinguished. Type Of These Variable Components Is Descriptive Indicator. Then, Preconditions Of Participation Have Been Mentioned. In This Stage, Long-Term Strategic Goals (Responding To Driving Forces In Basin Scale) With Vision Outlining (1415) And Middle-Term Strategic Goals (Responding To Pressure In Watershed Scale And Responding To State Of Ecological Zone) With Vision Outlining (1405) Has Been Determined In Order To Specify Sustainable Development Planning In This Land. In Evaluation Stage, Priority Of Watersheds Has Been Determined For Related Policies According To Variable Components. Appropriate Strategies For Decision Making And Monitoring Process Have Been Proposed. Finally, Optimum Mixture Of Policies Has Been Suggested For Sustainable Development Of This Land. Discussion And Results: The Role Of Human Activities In Degradation Of This Land (Urmia Basin) Is Indisputable. Land Degradation Driving Forces Are As Follows: 1. The Rapid Growth Of Urban Population, 2. Lack Of Appropriate Planning To Meet Population Needs, 3. Major And Nonproductive Employment In Agricultural Sector, 4. Low Literacy And Old Age In Farmers With Lands Reformation And Consequently Patches Fragmentation And Decreasing Production Efficiency, 5. Focus On Water Supply Approach And Dam Making In Water Resource Management, 6. Government Incumbency And Facilitating In Distribution Of Agricultural Inputs, Particularly Watersector Such As Hidden Subsidies Of Government For Water Supply By Lack Of Proper Water Pricing, 7. Lack Of Participation Of Agricultural Land Use Integrated Management Due To Participation Preconditions In Iran (Government Reliance On Oil Revenue), Thus Decision Making For Using Land Resource Is Merely Government-Owned. The Most Important Pressure Of Human Activity Is Also As Follows: 1. Construction Of Road Through The Middle Of The Lake And Consequently Water Flow Disorder. 2. Irregular Dam Making And Consequently Silent Rivers. 3. Land Cover Changes And Land Use Conversions. 4. Changes In Cultivation Pattern And Consequently Consuming More Water. 5. Serious Irrigation Deficiency. 6. Drilling Numerous Wells And Exploitation Of Underground Water Beyond The Limit Of The Water Tables. 7. Non Principal Faulty Salt Exploitation And Consequently Dust Aggravation. Conclusion: These Pressures Lead To Dominant Positive Feedbacks, Climatic Disturbances And Weather Quality Decadence, Quality And Quantity Of Water Resource And Decreasing And Degradation Of Natural Habitats. Finally, This Land Degradation Will Lead To Increase In Unemployment, Immigration, Social Insecurity And Protestation And Diseases. This Study By Using Sea In Urmia Watershed, Has Compiled Sustainable Development Policies. The Main Advantage Of This Study Is Incorporation Of The Results Of Sea And Dpsir. Completion Of The Method Used And The Result Can Be A Guide For Upstream Document Compilation For Sustainable Development Planning And Table 1. Middle-Term Strategies And Policies In Order To Respond To State Of Lake Urmia Ecological Zone (Table Presented) Programming In This Study Area. Also This Is A Proper Model For Compilation Of Upstream Documents Of Management In Other Ecosystems And Wetland Areas. Final Outcomes Of This Study Are Optimum Integration Of Strategies And Policies For Responding To State, Pressures And Drivers.	Dpsir Model, Lake Urmia, Policies, Sea, Na	NA	645-667	Scopus	40	2014
Article	Alibakhshi, S//Groen, Ta//Rautiainen, M//Naimi, B	Remotely-Sensed Early Warning Signals Of A Critical Transition In A Wetland Ecosystem	Remote Sensing	The Response Of An Ecosystem To External Drivers May Not Always Be Gradual And Reversible. Discontinuous And Sometimes Irreversible Changes, Called 'Regime Shifts' Or 'Critical Transitions', Can Occur. The Likelihood Of Such Shifts Is Expected To Increase For A Variety Of Ecosystems, And It Is Difficult To Predict How Close An Ecosystem Is To A Critical Transition. Recent Modelling Studies Identified Indicators Of Impending Regime Shifts That Can Be Used To Provide Early Warning Signals Of A Critical Transition. The Identification Of Such Transitions Crucially Depends On The Ability To Monitor Key Ecosystem Variables, And Their Success May Be Limited By Lack Of Appropriate Data. Moreover, Empirical Demonstrations Of The Actual Functioning Of These Indicators In Real-World Ecosystems Are Rare. This Paper Presents The First Study Which Uses Remote Sensing Data To Identify A Critical Transition In A Wetland Ecosystem. In This Study, We Argue That A Time Series Of Remote Sensing Data Can Help To Characterize And Determine The Timing Of A Critical Transition. This Can Enhance Our Abilities To Detect And Anticipate Them. We Explored The Potentials Of Remotely Sensed Vegetation (Ndvi), Water (Mndwi), And Vegetation-Water (Vwr) Indices, Obtained From Time Series Of Modis Satellite Images To Characterize The Stability Of A Wetland Ecosystem, Dorge Sangi, Near The Lake Urmia, Iran, That Experienced A Regime Shift Recently. In Addition, As A Control Case, We Applied The Same Methods To Another Wetland Ecosystem In Lake Arpi, Armenia Which Did Not Experience A Regime Shift. We Propose A New Composite Index (Mvwr) Based On Combining Vegetation And Water Indices, Which Can Improve The Ability To Anticipate A Critical Transition In A Wetland Ecosystem. Our Results Revealed That Mvwr In Combination With Autocorrelation At-Lag-1 Could Successfully Provide Early Warning Signals For A Critical Transition In A Wetland Ecosystem, And Showed A Significantly Improved Performance Compared To Either Vegetation (Ndvi) Or Water (Mndwi) Indices Alone. 2017 By The Authors.

Article	Alizadeh, Choobari, O//Ahmadi, Givi, F//Mirzaei, N//Owlad, E	Climate Change And Anthropogenic Impacts On The Rapid Shrinkage Of Lake Urmia	International Journal Of Climatology	Lake Urmia In Northwestern Corner Of Iran Was Once The Second Largest Hypersaline Lake Of The World, Covering On Average An Area Of 5200 Km2. However, The Lake Has Been Shrinking Rapidly Over The Last 20 Years, Primarily Due To Anthropogenic Influences, While Climate Change Has Had Also A Detectable Influence. Climate Change And Anthropohenic Impacts On The Rapid Shrinkage Of Lake Urmia Are Investigated Using Long-Term Surface Meteorological Records Of Weather Stations, While The Number Of Constructed Dams And Expansion Of Irrigated Areas In The Urmia Basin Are Also Examined. Over The Past Few Decades, A Warming Trend Of The Order 0.18 C Decade1 Has Been Identified, While Precipitation Has Been Decreasing By Approximately 9 Mm Decade1 Over The Basin. As A Consequence Of Such Significant Warming, Evaporation From The Lake Has Been Increasing By The Rate Of 6.2 Mm Decade1. The Increased Air Temperature And Evaporation, Along With The Decreased Precipitation Indicate That Lake Urmia Has Been Experiencing Meteorological Drought Conditions. The Main Anthropogenic Influence, On The Other Hand, Has Been Overwhelming Diversion Of Water Sources For Irrigation, Which Led To The Socioeconomic Drought Of The Region Because Demand For Water Has Exceeded The Supply. The Meteorological Drought, Combined By The Socioeconomic Drought, Have Contributed To The Significant Shrinkage Of Lake Urmia, Started From The Mid 1990S Water Level Peak, Although The Latter Has Had The Most Significant Contribution. As A Consequence, The Water Level Of Lake Urmia Has Been Rapidly Declining Since 1995, With 6.1 M Decline For The Period 19952009. Its Surface Area Has Been Also Changing By The Rate Of 188.3 Km2 Yr1, Reaching From 5503 Km2 In 1998 To 2323 Km2 In 2011. Under The Induced Meteorological And, More Importantly, Socioeconomic Drought Conditions, Substantial Improvements In Water Management Practices Are Required To Preserve Or Partially Restore The Lake. 2016 Royal Meteorological Society	Climate Change, Hypersaline Lake, Lake Urmia, Socioeconomic Drought, Surface Meteorological Records, Urmia Basin, Water Level, Atmospheric Temperature, Drought, Evaporation, Lakes, Shrinkage, Water Levels, Water Management, Anthropogenic Impacts, Anthropogenic Influence, Hypersaline Lakes, Lake Urmia, Management Practices, Meteorological Drought, Meteorological Records, Urmia Basin, Climate Change, Air Temperature, Anthropogenic Effect, Climate Change, Drought, Evaporation, Hypersaline Environment, Lacustrine Environment, Meteorology, Water Level, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1002/JOC.4630	4276-4286	Scopus	36	2016
Article	Amiri, V//Nakhaei, M//Lak, R//Kholghi, M	Assessment Of Seasonal Groundwater Quality And Potential Saltwater Intrusion: A Study Case In Urmia Coastal Aquifer (Nw Iran) Using The Groundwater Quality Index (Gqi) And Hydrochemical Facies Evolution Diagram (Hfe-D)	Stochastic Environmental Research And Risk Assessment	Coastal Aquifers Are At Threat Of Salinization In Most Parts Of The World. This Work Investigated The Seasonal Hydrochemical Evolution Of Coastal Groundwater Resources In Urmia Plain, Nw Iran. Two Recently Proposed Methods Have Been Used To Comparison, Recognize And Understand The Temporal And Spatial Evolution Of Saltwater Intrusion In A Coastal Alluvial Aquifer. The Study Takes Into Account That Saltwater Intrusion Is A Dynamic Process, And That Seasonal Variations In The Balance Of The Aquifer Cause Changes In Groundwater Chemistry. Pattern Diagrams, Which Constitute The Outcome Of Several Hydrochemical Processes, Have Traditionally Been Used To Characterize Vulnerability To Sea/Saltwater Intrusion. However, The Formats Of Such Diagrams Do Not Facilitate The Geospatial Analysis Of Groundwater Quality, Thus Limiting The Ability Of Spatio-Temporal Mapping And Monitoring. This Deficiency Calls For Methodologies Which Can Translate Information From Some Diagrams Such Piper Diagram Into A Format That Can Be Mapped Spatially. Distribution Of Groundwater Chemistry Types In Urmia Plain Based On Modified Piper Diagram Using Gqipiper(Mix) And Gqipiper(Dom) Indices That Mixed Camgcl And Ca-Hco3 Are The Dominant Water Types In The Wet And Dry Seasons, Respectively. In This Study, A Groundwater Quality Index Specific To Seawater Intrusion (Gqiswi) Was Used To Check Its Efficiency For The Groundwater Samples Affected By Urmia Hypersaline Lake, Iran. Analysis Of The Main Processes, By Means Of The Hydrochemical Facies Evolution Diagram (Hfe-Diagram), Provides Essential Knowledge About The Main Hydrochemical Processes. Subsequently, Analysis Of The Spatial Distribution Of Hydrochemical Facies Using Heatmaps Helps To Identify The General State Of The Aquifer With Respect To Saltwater Intrusion During Different Sampling Periods. The Hfe-D Results Appear To Be Very Successful For Differentiating Variations Through Time In The Salinization Processes Caused By Saltwater Intrusion Into The Aquifer, Distinguishing The Phase Of Saltwater Intrusion From The Phase Of Recovery, And Their Respective Evolutions. Both Gqi And Hfe-D Methods Show That Hydrochemical Variations Can Be Read In Terms Of The Pattern Of Saltwater Intrusion And Groundwater Quality Status. But Generally, In This Case (I.E. Saltwater And Not Seawater Intrusion) The Hfe-D Method Was Presented Better Efficiency Than Gqi Method (Including Gqipiper And Gqiswi). 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Article	Amiri, V//Nakhaei, M//Lak, R//Kholghi, M	Geophysical, Isotopic, And Hydrogeochemical Tools To Identify Potential Impacts On Coastal Groundwater Resources From Urmia Hypersaline Lake, Nw Iran	Environmental Science And Pollution Research	Measurements Of Major Ions, Trace Elements, Water-Stable Isotopes, And Geophysical Soundings Were Made To Examine The Interaction Between Urmia Aquifer (Ua) And Urmia Lake (Ul), Northwest Iran. The Poor Correlation Between Sampling Depth And Cl Concentrations Indicated That The Position Of Freshwater-Saltwater Interface Is Not Uniformly Distributed In The Study Area, And This Was Attributed To Aquifer Heterogeneities. The Targeted Coastal Wells Showed B/Cl And Br/Cl Molar Ratios In The Range Of 0.00222.43 And 0.000320.28, Respectively. The Base-Exchange Index (Bei) And Saturation Index (Si) Calculations Showed That The Salinization Process Followed By Cation-Exchange Reactions Mainly Controls Changes In The Chemical Composition Of Groundwater. All Groundwater Samples Are Depleted With Respect To 18O (11.71 To 9.4 ) And D (66.26 To 48.41 ). The 18O And D Isotope Ratios For Surface And Groundwater Had A Similar Range And Showed High Deuterium Excess (D-Excess) (21.11 To 31.16 ). The High D-Excess In Water Samples Is Because Of Incoming Vapors From The Ul Mixed With An Evaporated Moisture Flux From The Urmia Mainland And Incoming Vapors From The West (I.E., Mediterranean Sea). Some Saline Samples With Low B/Cl And Br/Cl Ratios Had Depleted 18O And D. In This Case, Due To Freshwater Flushing, The Drilled Wells In The Coastal Playas And Salty Sediments Could Have More Depleted Isotopes, More Cl, And Consequently Smaller B/Cl And Br/Cl Ratios. Moreover, The Results Of Hydrochemical Facies Evolution (Hfe) Diagram Showed That Because Of The Existence Fine-Grained Sediments Saturated With High Density Saltwater In The Coastal Areas That Act As A Natural Barrier, Increasing The Groundwater Exploitation Leads To Movement Of Freshwaters From Recharge Zones In The Western Mountains Not Saltwater From Ul. The Highly Permeable Sediments At The Junction Of The Rivers To The Lake Are Characterized By Low Hydraulic Gradient And High Hydraulic Conductivity. These Properties Enhance The Salinization Of Groundwater Observed In The Study Area. The Main Factors Influencing The Salinity Are Base-Exchange Reactions, Invasion Of Highly Diluted Saltwater, Dissolution Of Salty Pans, And Water Chemistry Evolution Along Flow Paths. 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Article	Amiri, V//Nakhaei, M//Lak, R//Kholghi, M	Investigating The Salinization And Freshening Processes Of Coastal Groundwater Resources In Urmia Aquifer, Nw Iran	Environmental Monitoring And Assessment	This Paper Presents The Results Of An Assessment About Interaction Between Urmia Lake (Ul) And Coastal Groundwater In The Urmia Aquifer (Ua). This Aquifer Is The Most Significant Contributor To The Freshwater Supply Of The Coastal Areas. The Use Of Hydrochemical Facies Can Be Very Useful To Identify The Saltwater Encroachment Or Freshening Phases In The Coastal Aquifers. In This Study, The Analysis Of Salinization/Freshening Processes Was Carried Out Through The Saturation Index (Si), Ionic Deltas (), Binary Diagrams, And Hydrochemical Facies Evolution (Hfe) Diagram. Based On The Gibbs Plot, The Behavior Of The Major Ions Showed That The Changes In The Chemical Composition Of The Groundwater Are Mainly Controlled By The Water-Soil/Rock Interaction Zone And Few Samples Are Relatively Controlled By Evaporation. A Possible Explanation For This Phenomenon Is That The Deposited Chloride And Sulfate Particles Can Form The Minor Salinity Source In Some Coastal Areas When Washed Down By Precipitation. The Si Calculations Showed That All Groundwater Samples, Collected In These Periods, Show Negative Saturation Indices, Which Indicate Undersaturation With Respect To Anhydrite, Gypsum, And Halite. In Addition, Except In A Few Cases, All Other Samples Showed The Undersaturation With Respect To The Carbonate Minerals Such As Aragonite, Calcite, And Dolomite. Therefore, These Minerals Are Susceptible To Dissolution. In The Dry Season, The Si Calculations Showed More Positive Values With Respect To Dolomite, Especially In The Northern Part Of Ua, Which Indicated A Higher Potential For Precipitation And Deposition Of Dolomite. The Percentage Of Saltwater In The Groundwater Samples Of Urmia Plain Was Very Low, Ranging Between 0.001 And 0.79% In The Wet Season And 0.0004 And 0.81% In The Dry Season. The Results Of Hfe Diagram, Which Was Taken To Find Whether The Aquifer Was In The Saltwater Encroachment Phase Or In The Freshening Phase, Indicated That Except For A Few Wells Near The Coast, There Is Very Little Hydraulic Interaction Between Ua And Ul. In This Coastal Area, Most Of The Samples That Were Collected Repeatedly In Both Wet And Dry Seasons Showed The Same Hydrochemical Facies, Which Suggested That The Seasonal Groundwater Fluctuations Cannot Significantly Change The Chemical Composition Of Groundwater. 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

We Investigated The Effects Of Salinity On Belowground Microbial Communities In Soils Collected From Fields Of Cultivated Onions (Allium Cepa L.) And Lucerne (Medicago Sativa L.), And Sites With The Native Halophyte Samphire (Salicornia Europaea L.). We Tested The Hypotheses That Salinity Reduces Microbial Biomass And Changes The Structure Of The Microbial Community. The Physical And Chemical Properties Of Soil Samples Were Analysed, And Phospholipid Fatty Acids Were Identified As Signatures For Various Microbial Groups. We Found That The Organic Carbon (Oc) Content Was The Dominant Determinant Of Microbial Biomass. We Also Found Linear Relationships Between Oc And The Biomass Of Various Groups Of Organisms Across The Wide Salinity Gradient Studied. Salinity, On The Other Hand, Caused Changes In The Microbial Fatty Acid Composition That Indicated Adaptation To Stress And Favoured Saprotrophic Fungi Over Bacteria, And Gram-Negative Bacteria Over Gram-Positive. Principal Component Analysis Showed That Salinity Variables And Microbial Stress Indices Formed One Group, And Oc And Microbial Biomass Another. The Importance Of Oc For High Microbial Biomass In Severely Stressed Soils Indicates That Oc Amendment May Be Used To Mitigate Salt Stress And As A Method Of Managing Saline Soils. 2015 Csiro.

Article	Chaudhari, S//Felfelani, F//Shin, S//Pokhrel, Y	Climate And Anthropogenic Contributions To The Desiccation Of The Second Largest Saline Lake In The Twentieth Century	Journal Of Hydrology	Urmia Lake, Once The Second Largest Saline Lake In The World, Is On The Verge Of Complete Desiccation. It Has Been Suggested That The Desiccation Is Caused By Intensified Human Activities, Especially Irrigation, And Prolonged Droughts In The Lake Basin, But There Is A Lack Of Quantitative Analysis To Attribute The Observed Water Level Decline To Natural And Anthropogenic Causes. In This Study, We Use Remote Sensing Data, Ground Observations, And A Hydrological Model With Human Impact Assessment Capabilities (Higw-Mat) To Investigate The Natural And Human-Induced Changes In The Hydrology Of Urmia Lake Basin From 1980 To 2010. Based On The Analysis Of Remote Sensing Data, We Find A 98% And 180% Increase In Agricultural Lands And Urban Areas, Respectively, From 1987 Through 2016, With A Corresponding Shrinkage In Lake Area By 86%. Further, We Use Model Results To Examine The Changes In Terrestrial Water Storage (Tws) Over The Basin Including The Lake. Results Indicate That Tws Declined Over The Lake Region And The Lake Lost Water At A Faster Rate Than The Watershed Did. Comparison Of River Inflow To The Lake From Two Simulationsone With And The Other Without Human Activitiessuggests That Human Water Management Activities Caused A Reduction In Streamflow Of 1.74 Km3/Year From 1995 To 2010, Which Accounts For 86% Of The Total Depletion In Lake Volume During The Same Period. It Is Also Found That Irrigation Water Requirement Almost Tripled, Causing High Withdrawals From Rivers. These Results Demonstrate That The On-Going Depletion Of Urmia Lake Is Not Solely Due To Prolonged Droughts But Also Due To Direct Anthropogenic Alterations Which Caused Significant Changes In Land Use, Streamflow, And Water Storage Within The Basin. This Study Provides Important Insights On The Natural And Human-Induced Changes In The Hydrology Of Urmia Lake And Highlights The Need For A High Resolution Regional Scale Modeling Approach For Better Understanding Potential Future Changes Toward Restoring The Lake And Putting Forth A Course Of Action To Stop Further Desiccation And Avoid A Major Environmental Catastrophe. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

According To The Degree Of Importance And The Role Of Each Defined Attribute, Different Weighting Scenarios Were Defined For Each Of The Attributes Relating To The Corresponding Group. The Goal Of This Paper Is To Select The Best Weighting Scenario For Attributes In The Roi Model For Estimating More Accurate And Reliable Quantiles Of 24-H Maximum Rainfall Over Urmia Lake Basin. The Investigation Of 140 Pooling Groups Built With The Roi Approach Showed That Each Of The Seven Groups Of Defined Attributes Has A Different Performance In The Estimation Of Quantiles. Moreover, Results Showed That, In Most Cases, Performance Of The Models With Weighted Attributes Was Better Than That Of The Non-Weighted Ones. Among The Seven Categories, The Statistical Attributes And Their Combination With Climatic And Geographical Attributes Had The Best Estimation Of Quantiles In Terms Of Low Relative Error. In Addition, Results Showed That Skewness Plays An Effective Role In The Estimation Of Quantiles. In General, It Can Be Concluded That By Applying Appropriate Weights For Available Attributes In Regions Without Data, The Acceptable And Reliable Results Of Extreme Values Can Be Earned At Ungauged Stations. Furthermore, Results Showed That The Use Of Median Of Metric Distance As One Of The Threshold Options Can Obtain Better Results In The Estimation Of Quantiles. 2018, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Austria, Part Of Springer Nature.

Article	Eimanifar, A//Asem, A//Djamali, M//Wink, M	A Note On The Biogeographical Origin Of The Brine Shrimp Artemia Urmiana Gnther, 1899 From Urmia Lake, Iran	Zootaxa	The Brine Shrimp Artemia Urmiana, An Abundant Inhabitant Of The Hypersaline Urmia Lake In Northwestern Iran, Has Re-Cently Been Described From Lake Koyashskoe, Also A Shallow Hypersaline Lake That Is Located On The Black Sea Coast Of The Crimean Peninsula (Ukraine). This Discovery Has Questioned The Endemicity Of A. Urmiana In Urmia Lake And Has Also Brought Into Question The Biogeographical Origin Of This Species. In The Present Study, We Combined Recent Genetic Diver-Gence Data (Mtdna-Coi) With Palaeoecological Evidence To Address The Biogeographical Origin Of A. Urmiana. Calibra-Tion Of The Molecular Clock Of The Coi Region Was Set By Assigning The Age Of The Micro-Crustacean Daphnia Pulex Minimally At 145 Mya. The Divergence Age Of A. Urmiana In Urmia Lake Dates Back To 383,000 Years, Whereas Ukrainian Artemia Reflects A Very Young Populations That Diverged About 196,000 Years Ago. Palaeoecological Evidence Suggests That The Age Of The Major Habitat Of A. Urmiana I.E. Urmia Lake Goes Back To The Tertiary Period While The Ukranian Habitats Of The Species Are Very Young, By Virtue Of Geological Features Of The Holocene Age. We Conclude That The Biogeographical Origin Of A. Urmiana Is Outside Of Europe And The Current State Of Knowledge Strongly Suggests That Urmia Lake Has Been The Major Source Of Its Expansion Into Its Modern Habitats In Europe.

Lake Urmia Is World'S Second Hyper-Saline Lake, With A Number Of Low Salinity Rivers Discharging Into The Lake, The Most Significant Of Which Is Zarrinehrud River. Based On Thermodynamic Calculations And On Field Data, The Theoretical Potential Of Energy Production At The Above System Has Been Calculated Between 400 And 1000 Mw, While The Technical Potential Is Expected Between 40 And 50% Of That.Two Processes For The Production Of Electricity From Salinity Gradients Were Investigated: Pro And Red. The Revenue Of Such Attempt Is A Function Of Membrane Cost, Power Density, Lifetime Expectation And Sale Price Of Electric Power. Based On The Available Technology, The Project Is Expected To Be Viable If Membranes With Power Density Above 5 W/M2 And 10 Years Lifetime Expectancy Or 10 W/M2 And 5 Years Lifetime Expectancy Will Be Used. The Cost Of Membranes For A 25 Mw Plant Has Been Estimated Between 75 And 150 Million Usd, While The Cost Of Electric Energy From A Full-Scale Pro Plant Is Expected To Be Between 65 And 130 Usd/Mwh (Comparable With The Cost Of Electric Energy Generated From Other Renewable Energy Sources). 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Article	Fathian, F//Dehghan, Z//Bazrkar, Mh//Eslamian, S	Trends In Hydrological And Climatic Variables Affected By Four Variations Of The Mann-Kendall Approach In Urmia Lake Basin, Iran	Hydrological Sciences Journal	Abstract: The Trends In Hydrological And Climatic Time Series Data Of Urmia Lake Basin In Iran Were Examined Using The Four Different Versions Of The Mann-Kendall (Mk) Approach: (I) The Original Mk Test, (Ii) The Mk Test Considering The Effect Of Lag-1 Autocorrelation, (Iii) The Mk Test Considering The Effect Of All Autocorrelation Or Sample Size, And (Iv) The Mk Test Considering The Hurst Coefficient. Identification Of Hydrological And Climatic Data Trends Was Carried Out At Monthly And Annual Time Scales For 25 Temperature, 35 Precipitation And 35 Streamflow Gauging Stations Selected From The Urmia Lake Basin. Mann-Kendall And Pearson Tests Were Also Applied To Explore The Relationships Between Temperature, Precipitation And Streamflow Trends. The Results Show Statistically Significant Upward And Downward Trends In The Annual And Monthly Hydrological And Climatic Variables. The Upward Trends In Temperature, Unlike Streamflow, Are Much More Pronounced Than The Downward Trends, But For Precipitation The Behaviour Of Trend Is Different On Monthly And Annual Time Scales. Furthermore, The Trend Results Were Affected By The Different Approaches. Specifically, The Number Of Stations Showing Trends In Hydrological And Climatic Variables Decreased Significantly (Up To 50%) When The Fourth Test Was Considered Instead Of The First And The Absolute Value Of The Z Statistic For Most Of The Time Series Was Reduced. The Results Of Correlations Between Streamflow And Climatic Variables Showed That The Streamflow In Urmia Lake Basin Is More Sensitive To Changes In Temperature Than Those Of Precipitation. The Observed Decreases In Streamflow And Increases In Temperature In The Urmia Lake Basin In Recent Decades May Thus Have Serious Implications For Water Resources Management Under The Warming Climate With The Expected Population Growth And Increased Freshwater Consumption In This Region.

Detection And Identification Of These Changes Is Necessary And Is The First Step Of Any Study Or Planning For Natural Resource Management. Synthetic Aperture Radar (Sar) Imagery, Thanks To Its Independence To Weather Conditions And Sun Illumination, Is A Powerful Tool For These Studies. In This Research An Unsupervised Change Detection Framework Based On The Kernel-Based Clustering Technique Is Presented. Kernel C-Means Algorithm Is Employed To Separate The Changes Classes From The No-Changes. This Method Is A Non-Linear Algorithm Which Considers The Contextual Information. Using The Kernel Functions, The Projecting Of The Data Into A Higher Dimensional Space Helps To Make The Non-Linear Features More Separable In A Linear Space. The Proposed Methodology Has Applied To Dual-Pol L-Band Sar Images Acquired By The Alos From Urmia Lake.

We Assess Landslide Susceptibility For The Nearly 20.000 Km2 Large Study Area Of The Urmia Lake Basin Which Is Dominated By Agricultural Land Use But Includes The Major Settlements Areas Of The East Azerbaijan Province, Iran. Landslide Factors Are Established In Form Of Gis Dataset Layers Including Topography, Geology, Climatology And Land Use. After Pre-Processing All Data Layers Are Standardized Based On A Fuzzy Logic Model. An Analytical Hierarchical Process (Ahp) Delivers The Weights For The Gis-Analysis. Datasets Are Combined By Gis Spatial Analysis Techniques And A Landslide Susceptibility Map Of The Study Area Is Created. An Existing Inventory Of Known Landslides Within The Case Study Area Was Compared With The Resulting Susceptibility Map. We Found That High Susceptible Zones Cover About 4.47% (944 Km2) Of The Total Area Whereby Geological Outcrops Of Sedimentary And Volcanic Formations Such As Volcanic Ash Contribute Most To The Landslide Susceptibility. Due To The Dynamic Growth Of Settlements Especially In The Vicinity Of The City Of Tabriz Landslide Hazards May Cause Even More Damage In The Future.The Resulting Information Of This Research Is Useful For A) A Better Understanding Of Existing Landslides And Their Origins In North-Western Iran, B) Supporting Emergency Decisions And C) Prioritization Of Efforts For The Reduction And Mitigation Of Future Landslide Hazards.

Article	Fijani, E//Moghaddam, Aa//Tsai, Ftc//Tayfur, G	Analysis And Assessment Of Hydrochemical Characteristics Of Maragheh-Bonab Plain Aquifer, Northwest Of Iran	Water Resources Management	The Present Study Aims At Assessing The Hydrochemistry Of The Groundwater System Of The Maragheh-Bonab Plain Located In The East Azarbaijan Province, Northwest Of Iran. The Groundwater Is Used Mainly For Drinking, Agriculture And Industry. The Study Also Discusses The Issue Of The Industrial Untreated Wastewater Discharge To The Plain Aquifer That Is A High Ca-Cl Water Type With Tds Value Of About 150G/L. The Hydrogeochemical Study Is Conducted By Collecting And Analyzing The Groundwater Samples From July And September Of 2013. The Studied System Contains Three Major Groundwater Types, Namely Camghco3, Nacl, And Non-Dominant Water, Based On The Analysis Of The Major Ions. The Main Processes Contributing To Chemical Compositions In The Groundwater Are The Dissolution Along The Flow Path, Dedolomitisation, Ion Exchange Reactions, And The Mixing With Wastewater. According To The Computed Water Quality Index (Wqi) Ranging From 25.45 To 194.35, The Groundwater In The Plain Can Be Categorized Into Excellent Water, Good Water, And Poor Water. There Is A Resemblance Between The Spatial Distribution Of The Wqi And Hydrochemical Water Types In The Piper Diagram. The Excellent Quality Water Broadly Coincides With The Ca-Mg-Hco3 Water Type. The Poor Water Matches With The Nacl Water Type, And The Good Quality Water Coincides With Blended Water. The Results Indicate That This Aquifer Suffers From Intense Human Activities Which Are Forcing The Aquifer Into A Critical Condition. 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

In This Paper, A Hybrid Statistical Method Is Introduced To Detect Fa Events Of Persiann Dataset Over Urmia Lake Basin In Northwest Of Iran. The Main Fa Detection Model Is Based On Bayesian Theorem At Which Four Predictor Parameters Including Persiann Rainfall Estimations, Brightness Temperature (Tb), Precipitable Water (Pw) And Near Surface Air Temperature (Tair) Is Considered As Its Input Dataset. In Order To Decrease The Dimensions Of Input Dataset By Summarizing Their Most Important Modes Of Variability And Correlations To The Reference Dataset, A Technique Named Singular Value Decomposition (Svd) Is Used. The Application Of Bayesian-Svd Method In Fa Detection Of Urmia Lake Basin Resulted In A Trade-Off Between Fa Detection And Hit Events Loss. The Results Show Success Of Proposed Method In Detecting About 30% Of Fa Events In Return For Loss Of About 12% Of Hit Events While Better Capability Of This Method In Cold Seasons Is Observed. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

This Study Evaluates The Precipitation Estimation From Remotely Sensed Information Using Artificial Neural Networks (Persiann) Daily Data Set From 2000 To 2011 In 69 Pixels Over A Semiarid Basin In Northwest Iran And Compares It With The Data Set Of The Existing Rain-Gauge Network. Different Analytical Approaches And Measures Are Used To Examine Persiann Performance Seasonally And Categorically. The Residuals Are Also Decomposed Into True Positive (Hit), False Negative (Miss), And False Alarm (Fa) Estimate Biases In Addition To Systematic And Random Error Components. The Results Show Seasonal Variability Of Persiann Precision In Rainfall Detection With Substantial Errors During Winter And Summer That Are Associated With High Rates Of Fa Ratio (More Than 60%). The Value Of Miss And Fa Biases (124 And -77,000 Mm, Respectively, Within The Total Data Set) Are Considerably Larger Than Hit And Total Bias (27 And 74,000 Mm, Respectively) Because These Components Contribute Conversely And Compensate Each Other By Their Opposite Signs. Moreover, Persiann Detects Heavy Rainfalls Well With A Probability Of Detection (Pod) Over 80%, But With Serious Biases. Generally, Although The Detection Ability Of Persiann Improves As The Rate Of Rainfall Increases, Its Systematic Error In Simulation Of The Rainfall Process Also Increases (From 5% Systematic Error To 90% In Heavier Rainfalls), Leading To A Low Level Of Accuracy In The Estimation Of Precipitation Rate. 2018 American Society Of Civil Engineers.

Under Osmotic Stress	Journal Of Plant Growth Regulation	A Common Problem With Vegetable Production In Saline Areas Is Poor Crop Stand, But For Black Cumin (Nigella Sativa L.) Germination Data Are Limited And Inconsistent. The Effects Of Chemical Priming With Urmia Lake Salt And Urea Solutions For 16H At 30C On Seed Germination And Seedling Growth Of Black Cumin (Nigella Sativa L.) Were Studied Under Various Osmotic Stress Levels. For A More Detailed Assessment Of Chemical Priming, The Effects Of Hydropriming For 16H At 30C Were Also Studied. A Seed Lot That Was Not Exposed To Any Treatment, Except Disinfection, Was Used As Control. Osmotic Stress Levels Were 2, 4, 6, And 8Bar, Which Were Achieved With Polyethylene Glycol 6000 (Peg 6000). Seed Germination Of Black Cumin Was Reduced By 16.2%, 33.8%, 50.9%, And 74.9% Under Osmotic Potential 2, 4, 6, And 8Bar, Respectively, Compared With Non-Stressed Control. Improved Germination Index Values, Reduced Mean Germination Time, And Increased Coefficients Of Velocity Of Germination Were Observed Under Osmotic Stress In Primed Seeds Compared With Non-Primed Control. Averaged Over Priming Treatments, Priming Improved The Final Germination Percentage By 10.5%, 24.3%, 45.5%, And 74.6% Under Osmotic Potential 2, 4, 6, And 8Bar, Respectively. Post-Germination Growth Was Also Inhibited Under Low Osmotic Potential Compared With The Non-Stressed Control. Nevertheless, Priming Improved Length And Weight Of Black Cumin Seedlings And Enhanced Peroxidase And Catalase Activity At All Osmotic Potential Levels Compared With Non-Primed Seeds. Higher Seedling Vigor Indices Were Recorded In Seedlings From Primed Seeds With Decreasing Osmotic Potential Levels Than Non-Primed Seeds. Urmia Lake Salt Priming Had The Greatest Impact On Improving Seed Germination And Vigor Indices, Especially Under Osmotic Stress Conditions. Although Seed Priming Did Not Completely Eliminate The Symptoms Of Osmotic Stress In Black Cumin Germination, It Is An Efficient Method To Mitigate The Impact Of Osmotic Stress On Germination Of This Species. 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, Llc, Part Of Springer Nature.

Tested Scenarios, Proposed By Urmia Lake Restoration Program Committee, Include: Preservation Of Current Lake Status (No Intervention), Complete Closing Of Shahid Kalantari Causeway, Dyke Construction In The Southern Part Of Lake Urmia, Water Transfer From Zarrinehrood River To Siminehrood River And Reduction Of Agricultural Water Consumption By Best Agricultural Practices. Results Indicate That Neither The Closure Of The Causeway Nor The Construction Of The Southern Dyke Would Significantly Improve Lake Conditions When Compared To Preservation Of Current Lake Status. The Water Transfer Alternative Doesn'T Seem To Have Any Effect On The Current Lake Conditions Either. However, The Reduction On Water Diversions By Improving Agricultural Practices In The Lake'S Basin Leads To A Partial Restoration Of The Lake In Terms Of Water Level, Surface Area And Volume. If Current Conditions Persist, Salinity In The Northern Part Of Lake Urmia Will Reach Supersaturation Levels (340 G/L), Generating Further Salt Deposits. 2018 International Association For Great Lakes Research	Ecological Level, Lake Urmia, Modelling, Restoration, Salinization, Agriculture, Bridges, Causeways, Flood Control, Image Reconstruction, Models, Restoration, Software Testing, Water Levels, Water Management, Water Supply, 2D Shallow Waters, Agricultural Practices, Agricultural Water, Ecological Level, Hydrologic Restorations, Lake Urmia, Partial Restoration, Salinization, Lakes, Dike, Ecological Approach, Numerical Model, Salinity, Salinization, Supersaturation, Two-Dimensional Modeling, Water Level, Water Use, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1016/J.JGLR.2018.10.002	87-97	Scopus	45	2019
Article	Hamzehpour, N//Eghbal, Mk//Abasiyan, Sma//Dill, Hg	Pedogenic Evidence Of Urmia Lake'S Maximum Expansion In The Late Quaternary	Catena	The Urmia Lake Recession, And The Resulting Increase In Vast Barren Area Around It, Has Been Rapid In Recent Decades And Thus Has Attracted Attention Of Environmentalists And Geoscientists Alike. However, Evidence For Its Different Strandlines And The Largest Extension Of The Lake During The Late Quaternary Has Not Been Reported Yet. The Principal Goals Of The Current Research Were To Figure Out Pedological Evidence Of Its Maximum Expansion During The Late Quaternary And Mapping Out The Different Strandlines Along The Western Shores Of Urmia Lake Over Time. Thirty-Two Soil Pedons At Different Landscape Positions, Geomorphic Surfaces And Distances From Urmia Lake Were Studied During Autumn In 2013 And 2014. Micromorphological And Mineralogical Studies Were Performed For Some Diagnostic Horizons. Results Showed Along The Transect Under Study Three Different Entities Diagnostic Of The Lake'S History (1) Lithological Discontinuities, (2) Saline Lacustrine Sediments, (3) Buried Soils. However, Almost 2 Km From The Closest Pedon To The Lake, No Evidence Of Saline Playa Sediments Were Detected. Based On Previous Chronology Results From Urmia Lake, Which Indicated High Lake Levels With Very Low Salinity Since About 180 Ky Bp, The Sediments Of This Part Of The Study Area Were Considered To Have Been Deposited At The Same Period Of Time, Indicating A Maximum Expansion Of Urmia Lake During The Late Quaternary. The Current Results Demonstrate That Soil Pedons Which Were Situated At Various Distances From Urmia Lake Denote Different Stages Of The Lacustrine Evolution. Along With The Distance From The Lake The Development Of Soils Increases. Due To A Longer And More Intensive Impact Of Pedogenic Processes On The Topstratum The Overall Soil System Becomes More Mature. The Study Of Buried Soils And Their Comparison To Upper Non-Buried Soils Revealed That In Some Cases, The Buried Soils Were More Evolved Than Their Upper Soils Or Vice Versa. Through These Observations, The Periods Of Exposure To Soil-Forming Processes After Each Sedimentation Period Was Detected And Schematic Diagrams Illustrating Periods Of Highstands And Lowstands (Recessions) Of Urmia Lake Were Reconstructed. This Study Demonstrates That Even Though Multiple Episodes Of Lake Recession Were Apparent, The Level Of Urmia Lake Increased During Hydroclimatic Events Conducive To Lake Expansion, Which Affected The Soil Evolution Due To Several Fluctuations During The Late Quaternary. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Article	Jalilvand, E//Tajrishy, M//Ghazi, Zadeh, Hashemi, Sa//Brocca, L	Quantification Of Irrigation Water Using Remote Sensing Of Soil Moisture In A Semi-Arid Region	Remote Sensing Of Environment	Irrigated Agriculture Is The Principal Consumer Of Fresh Water Resources. Most Countries Do Not Have A Precise Measurement Of Water Consumption For Irrigation. In This Study, An Innovative Approach Is Proposed That Allows For Estimation Of Irrigation Water Use At The Catchment Scale Based On Satellite Soil Moisture Data. To This End, The Sm2Rain Algorithm, Which Had Been Originally Developed For Estimation Of Rainfall From The Soil Moisture Observations, Is Adopted. The Satellite Soil Moisture Observations Obtained From Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (Amsr2) Along With Different Rainfall And Evapotranspiration (Et) Products In The Period 20122015 Are Used As The Input To The Model. The Methodology Is Tested In The Agricultural Plains Of Southern Urmia Lake, Which Is One Of The Main Agricultural Plains In Iran For Which Actual Irrigation Data Is Available. The Results Reveal That The Proposed Approach Can Capture The Overall Irrigation Pattern, Although, It Is Systematically Overestimating Irrigation Volume Compared To Observed Irrigation Data. Thus The Bias Is Calculated Over Largely Non-Irrigated Pixels And Used To Modify The Model Estimates. The Bias-Corrected Results Show Good Agreement With The In Situ Irrigation Data. In Particular, The Average Model Performance In The Irrigated Pixels In Terms Of R And Rmse (Mm/Month) Are (0.86 And 12.895) Respectively. Accuracy Varied Depending On The Inputs, With Improvement In Order Of 11% And 42% In R And Rmse Depending On The Inputs Chosen. The Method Is Also Applied To Less Irrigated Areas That Result In Obtaining Significantly Lower Irrigation Rates. The Low Spatial Resolution Of Soil Moisture Products (I.E. ~50 Km) Makes It Difficult To Capture The Irrigation Water Of Small Irrigated Croplands. Unreliable Rainfall And Et Data Can Also Lead To The Over/Underestimation Of Irrigation. In Spite Of The Above Limitations (Particularly Lack Of Reliable Et Dataset), The Proposed Model Can Still Capture The Irrigation Pattern, Given That Strong Soil Moisture Signal From Irrigation Is Detected By The Satellite. 2019 Elsevier Inc.

In Recent Decades, The Water Level Of The Largest Lake In Iran, Urmia Lake, Has Decreased Sharply, Which Has Become A Major Environmental Concern In Iran And The Region. The Efforts To Revive The Lake Concerns The Amount Of Water Required For Restoration. This Study Monitored And Assessed Urmia Lake Status Over A Period Of 30Years (1984 To 2014) Using Remotely Sensed Data. A Novel Method Is Proposed That Generates A Lakebed Digital Elevation Model (Lbdem) For Urmia Lake Based On Time Series Images From Landsat Satellites, Water Level Field Measurements, Remote Sensing Techniques, Gis, And 3D Modeling. The Volume Of Water Required To Restore The Lake Water Level To That Of Previous Years And The Ecological Water Level Was Calculated Based On Lbdem. The Results Indicate A Marked Change In The Area And Volume Of The Lake From Its Maximum Water Level In 1998 To Its Minimum Level In 2014. During This Period, 86% Of The Lake Became A Salt Desert And The Volume Of The Lake Water In 2013 Was Just 0.83% Of The 1998 Volume. The Volume Of Water Required To Restore Urmia Lake From Benchmark Status (In 2014) To Ecological Water Level (1274.10M) Is 12.546Bm3, Excluding Evaporation. The Results And The Proposed Method Can Be Used By National And International Environmental Organizations To Monitor And Assess The Status Of Urmia Lake And Support Them In Decision-Making. 2017, Springer International Publishing Ag.	3D Modeling, Gis, Lakebed Topography, Long-Term Monitoring, Remote Sensing, Urmia Lake, Aquatic Ecosystems, Climate Change, Decision Making, Ecology, Geographic Information Systems, Remote Sensing, Restoration, Water Levels, Water Resources, 3-D Modeling, Arid And Semi-Arid Regions, Digital Elevation Model, Environmental Organizations, Long Term Monitoring, Quantitative Assessments, Remote Sensing Techniques, Water Resources Management, Lakes, Lake Water, Sodium Chloride, Water, Digital Elevation Model, Environmental Monitoring, Gis, Lake Water, Quantitative Analysis, Remote Sensing, Three-Dimensional Modeling, Topography, Water Level, Article, Desert, Ecosystem Restoration, Environmental Monitoring, Evaporation, Geographic Information System, Iran, Quantitative Analysis, Remote Sensing, Satellite Imagery, Three Dimensional Imaging, Time Series Analysis, Water Analysis, Chemistry, Climate Change, Desert Climate, Ecology, Ecosystem, Lake, Procedures, Satellite Imagery, Statistics And Numerical Data, Theoretical Model, Water Supply, Iran, Lake Urmia, Climate Change, Desert Climate, Ecology, Ecosystem, Environmental Monitoring, Iran, Lakes, Models, Theoretical, Satellite Imagery, Water, Water Supply	10.1007/S10661-017-6308-5	NA	Scopus	189	2017
Article	Kakahaji, H//Banadaki, Hd//Kakahaji, A//Kakahaji, A	Prediction Of Urmia Lake Water-Level Fluctuations By Using Analytical, Linear Statistic And Intelligent Methods	Water Resources Management	Undoubtedly, The Most Significant Factor With Wise Decision Making And Designing Hydrological Structures Along The Lake Coasts Is An Accurate Model Of Lake Level Changes. This Issue Becomes More And More Important As Recent Global Climate Changes Have Completely Reformed The Behavior Of Traditional Lake Level Fluctuations. Subsequently, Estimating Lake Levels Becomes More Important And At The Same Time More Difficult. This Paper Deals With Modeling Lake Level Changes Of Lake Urmia Located In North-West Of Iran, In Terms Of Both Simulator And Predictor Models. According To This, Two Traditional Simulator Models Based On Water Budget Are Developed Which Benefit From Most Effective Components On Water Budget Namely Precipitation, Evaporation, Inflow And The Lake Level Antecedents, As Model Inputs. Most Famous Linear Modeling Tools, Autoregressive With Exogenous Input (Arx) And Box-Jenkins (Bj) Models Are Employed With The Same Mentioned Inputs For Prediction Purpose. In Addition, Two Other Methods That Are, Multi-Layer Perceptron (Mlp) Neural Network And Also Local Linear Neuro-Fuzzy (Llnf) Are Applied To Investigate Capability Of Intelligent Nonlinear Methods For Lake Level Changes Prediction. All Models Performances Are Indicated Using Both Graph And Numerical Illustrations And Results Are Discussed. Comparative Results Reveal That The Intelligent Methods Are Superior To Traditional Models For Modeling Lake Level Behavior As Complex Hydrological Phenomena. 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Article	Karbassi, A//Bidhendi, Gn//Pejman, A//Bidhendi, Me	Environmental Impacts Of Desalination On The Ecology Of Lake Urmia	Journal Of Great Lakes Research	Lake Urmia, The Second Largest Hypersaline Lake By Area In The World, Has Fluctuated In Salinity Over Time, But In Recent Years, It Has Reached A Maximum Of 340G/L. The Lake Is The Main Habitat For The Endemic Iranian Brine Shrimp, Artemia Urmiana, And Is A Protected Aquatic Environment. Efforts Have Been Made By The Iranian Government To Enhance The Diversity Of Its Wildlife. One Approach Has Been To Look For A Method To Reduce The Salt Content Of The Lake. We Investigate The Feasibility Of This By First Considering The Water Chemistry Of Lake Urmia And Then The Various Technologies Used To Extract Salt From Marine And Brackish Waters. Average Concentrations Of Na, Mg, K, Ca, Cl, So4, And Hco3 Were 125G/L, 11.3G/L, 2.63G/L, 0.55G/L, 216G/L, 22.4G/L, And 1.38G/L, Respectively, And Cations And Anions Were Balanced, However, Lake Urmia Waters Have A 'Very High' Salinity Hazard And A High Sodium Adsorption Ratio (Sar). Moreover, The Saturation Index (Si) For Each Of The Major Cations Was Greater Than Zero, Indicating That The Water In Lake Urmia Is Supersaturated, And Precipitation Is Likely. The Extraction Of Available Salts From The Lake For The Use In Petrochemical Industries Is Economically Feasible. However, Technologies Based On Removing Salts By Distillation Or Reverse Osmosis And Then Using This Fresh Water To Dilute Lake Salinity Are Problematic. A Better Strategy Would Be Better To Allow More Fresh Water To Reach The Lake Rather Than Creating Fresh Water Through Reverse Osmosis And Distillations Processes. While Concerns Have Been Raised About The Salinity Tolerance Of A. Urmiana, It Has Successfully Tolerated Various Salinity Ranges From 166 To 340G/L, And So The Species Is Not Threatened, Unless The Lake Desiccates. Because The Lake Is Saturated With Salts, It Seems Unlikely That Salinity Could Increase Much Higher. 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The Sand Particles Of These Dunes Are Smaller Than 300 M And Are Aragonitic (Calcareous). In This Research, The Potential Of Stabilizing And Fixing Of Calcareous Sand Dunes Of Jabal Kandi Region By Spraying Diluted Industrial Phosphoric Acid As A Novel Mulching Liquid Was Considered For The First Time. Due To The Chemical Reaction Of Calcareous Sand With Diluted Phosphoric Acid, In Situ Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate Cement Is Produced, Which Sticks The Unreacted Part Of Sand Particles Together And Leads To The Creation Of A Stiff Calcium Carbonate/Phosphate Crust. The Results Of The Laboratory Tests Including Measuring The Penetration Resistance And Wind Erosion Modulus Of The Crust Showed That Through The Use Of Adequate Percentage And Volume Of Phosphoric Acid, The Produced Crust Had A Considerable Mechanical Strength And Could Control The Wind Erosion Of The Stabilized Sand. This Method Could Be Executed With A Controlled Plan To Fix Some Shifting Sand Dunes, Stop Their Drifting And Change Them To Windbreakers, Especially Near Rural Areas And Agricultural Lands. Also, In The Untreated Areas Between The Fixed Sand Dunes, Re Vegetation Plans Could Be Executed. 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Calcareous Sand, Dicalcium Phosphate, Mulch, Phosphoric Acid, Sand Dune, Urmia Lake, Aragonite, Arid Region, Chemical Reaction, Coastal Zone, Desertification, Dilution, Dune, Laboratory Method, Mulching, Penetration, Phosphate, Research Work, Sand, Shrinkage, Water Level, Wind Erosion, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1016/J.JARIDENV.2017.09.011	34-44	Scopus	148	2018

Considering The Immunocompromised Nature Of Transplant Recipients Due To Immunosuppression, They Are Generally Prone To Viral And Bacterial Infectious Diseases. In This Study We Sought To Investigate The Seroprevalence Of Hp Infection Among Iranian Kidney Transplant Recipients. We Selected Randomly 91 Kidney Transplant Patients Who Were Examined For Anti- Hp Immunoglobulin G (Igg) Using An Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay Method (Lake Success, Ny, Usa). Forty-Three Subjects (47.3%) Were Seropositive For Anti-Hev Igg. There Was No Difference By Age (P =.49), Sex (P =.22), Blood Transfusion History (P =.19), Or Hemodialysis History (P =.46) Between Seropositive And Seronegative Groups, But There Was A Significant Difference Regarding The Educational Status Of The Subjects (P =.03), The Difference Was Not Confirmed By Considering Diploma As The Cut Point To Categorize Subjects (P >.05). Comparing Age Groups, Pearson Chi-Square Analysis Revealed No Significant Correlation Between Hp Seropositivity And Increasing Age (P =.963), Even When Controlled For Sex, Educational Status, History Of Blood Transfusion, Or Hemodialysis. The Frequency Of Transplant Recipients With Anti-Hp Igg Antibodies In Our Institution (47.3%) Was Not Higher Than That In The General Population (Almost 60% In Urmia).

The Nauplii Hatched From The Cysts Were Cultured Until Adulthood Under Two Salinities (150 And 250 G L-1) And Two Light Treatments (Par And Par+Uvr) In The Laboratory. Finally, The Artemia Were Analyzed For Their Concentration Of Maas. In Most Of The Cases, The Higher Salinity Level Applied Was Found To Increase The Maa Concentrations In Both Artemia Populations Significantly. The Acquisition Efficiency Of Maas In Both Artemia Populations Increased Under Exposure To Uvr-Supplemented Photosynthetically Active Radiation (Par) Compared To Those Raised Under Par, Except For Porphyra-334. It Was Observed That Combination Of Uv Radiation And Elevated Salinity Significantly Increased The Bioaccumulation Of Maas. Thus, The Presence Of These Compounds In These Populations Of Artemia May Increase Their Adaptability For Living In High-Uv And High-Salinity Conditions Prevailing In Lake Urmia. Higher Concentrations Of Maas In The Parthenogenetic Population Of Artemia Could Be Probably Attributed To Its Mono Sex Nature And Higher Adaptation Capacities To Extreme Environmental Conditions. This Study Examined The Effects Of Salinity And Artificial Uv Radiation On Accumulation Of Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids (Maas) In Sexual And Parthenogenetic Artemia From Lake Urmia. The Results Showed A Significant Increase In Maa Concentrations In Both Artemia Populations By Increment Of Water Salinity. Also, The Acquisition Efficiency Of Maas In Both Artemia Populations Increased Under Exposure To Uvr-Supplemented Photosynthetically Active Radiation (Par) Compared To Those Raised Under Par.

Conference Paper	Moghaddasi, M//Morid, S//Delavar, M//Arabpour, F	Managing Of The Agriculture Water Consumption To Meet The Environmental Flows Of The Lake Urmia During The Droughts	Drought: Research And Science-Policy Interfacing - Proceedings Of The International Conference On Drought: Research And Science-Policy Interfacing	The Lake Urmia (Lu) Water Level Has Declined Steeply During The Last Decade. The Lake'S Basin Crosses Political Boundaries Of Three Provinces (West Azerbaijan, East Azerbaijan And Kurdistan), Which Is A Determinant Constraint For Any Basin-Wide Planning. An Integrated Plan To Save The Lake Was Drawn By The Lu Basin Stakeholders Which Resulted In A Treaty Allocating 3100 Mcm Of Water Per Year To The Lake, While The Total Renewable Water Of The Basin Is About 6800 Mcm Per Year The Only Way To Fulfill Such An Agreement Is To Manage And Reduce The Basin'S Agriculture Water Consumption As The Main Water Consumer. This Reduction Should Be Wisely Implemented So That The Basin Suffers Minimum Loss. The Fact That Will Be More Complicated During Droughts And Water Scarcity Situations. This Issue Constructs The Objective Of This Paper. Reduction Of Cropped Area And Deficit Irrigation Were Considered As Feasible Measures In This Regard. Furthermore, Different Models Were Developed For The Required Simulations And Optimizations In A Way That The Agriculture Sector Suffered Minimum Loss. The Models Were Run For A 49 Year Period Of Naturalized Water Yield Of The Basin. Also, Two Scenarios Were Taken Into Consideration For Water Delivery To The Lake, Including Full And Partial, With Regard To The Wetness And Dryness Of The Water Year. The Results Indicated That, It Would Be Necessary To Reduce 25% To 35% Of East Azerbaijan Province Agricultural Water Consumption And Also About 15% To 25% For West Azerbaijan Province In Order To Be Able To Achieve The Goal. At The Present Time, Kurdistan Province Needs No Reduction To Fulfill Its Commitments. 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, London, Uk.

The Present Study Is Part Of The Lake Urmia Drought Risk Management (Drm) That Suggests A Drought Warning System With Measures To Reduce Agricultural Water Consumption And Allocate A Reasonable Amount Of Water For The Lake At Each Drought Level. The Approaches To Reduce Agricultural Demand Include Reductions In Cropped Area And Deficit Irrigation, These Have Been Accepted By Stakeholders And Are Calculated By Means Of Optimization Models. Strategies To Allocate Water To Lake Urmia Include Full Allocation Of 3100 Mcm Yr1 (The New Water Allocation Of The Lake) Or Up To 65% Partial Allocation Of This Amount In Accordance With The Severity Of Drought. These Policies Were Simulated For The Agricultural And Environmental Sectors Throughout The Historical And Generated Time Series For Streamflow. The Results Of Simulation Show That The New Water Allocations Put Increasing Pressure On The Agricultural Sector And The Basin Will Remain Under Water Scarcity For More Than 50% Of The Time After Applying The Drm. It Is A Unique Way To Save The Lake, Which Will Otherwise Dry Up Within A Decade. The Methodology Can Be Recommended To Model Components Of Similar Drought Plans Which Will Benefit From Its Applicability And Objectivity. Copyright 2017 John Wiley &Amp, Sons, Ltd.

The Lake Is In Immediate And Great Danger And Is Rapidly Going To Become Barren Desert. As A Result, The Increasing Demands Upon Groundwater Resources Due To Expanding Metropolitan And Agricultural Areas Are A Serious Challenge In The Surrounding Regions Of Lake Urmia. The Continuous Gps Measurements Around The Lake Illustrate Significant Subsidence Rate Between 2005 And 2009. The Objective Of This Study Was To Detect And Specify The Non-Linear Correlation Of Land Subsidence And Temperature Activities In The Region From 2005 To 2009. For This Purpose, The Cross Wavelet Transform (Xwt) Was Carried Out Between The Two Types Of Time Series, Namely Vertical Components Of Gps Measurements And Daily Temperature Time Series. The Significant Common Patterns Are Illustrated In The High Period Bands From 180-218 Days Band (6-7 Months) From September 2007 To February 2009. Consequently, The Satellite Altimetry Data Confirmed That The Maximum Rate Of Linear Trend Of Water Variation In The Lake From 2005 To 2009, Is Associated With Time Interval From September 2007 To February 2009. This Event Was Detected By Xwt As A Critical Interval To Be Holding The Strong Correlation Between The Land Subsidence Phenomena And Surface Temperature. Eventually The Analysis Can Be Used For Modeling And Prediction Purposes And Probably Stave Off The Damage From Subsidence Phenomena. Author(S) 2013.

Genotypes	Journal International Des Sciences De La Vigne Et Du Vin	Aim: To Study The Salinity Tolerance Of Own Rooted Grape Cuttings Taken From Nine Table Grape (Vitis Vinifera L.) Genotypes Growing In The Urmia Salt Lake Region (Iran): Laalebidaneh, Gharashani, Sachagh, Shahroodi, Laaiesefid, Khalili, Chawga, Ghezeluzum And Gharagandomeh. Methods And Results: Plants Were Treated With Nutrient Solutions Containing 0, 25, 50 And 100 Mm Nacl For Two Weeks. Shoot And Root Growth And Dry Weights (Dw) Were Significantly (P&Lt,0.05) Reduced In All Treatments. Chloride (Cl) And Sodium (Na+) Ions Highly Accumulated In The Various Parts Of The Vines With Increasing External Nacl Concentration. Na+ Accumulation Exceeded That Of Cl In All Treatments And All Genotypes. However, Gharashani Showed A Higher Ability To Restrict Cl And Na+ Accumulation In Lamina (1.08% Of Dw And 2.56% Of Dw, Respectively) In Comparison To The Other Genotypes, Particularly To Ghezeluzum (4.1% Of Dw And 9.10% Of Dw, Respectively), Which Showed Intensive Leaf Burn Symptoms. Lamina Soluble Sugar, Proline And Glycine Betaine Contents Increased With Increasing Salinity. Correlation Analysis (P&Lt,0.01) Indicated That There Was A High Positive Correlation Between Cl And Na+ Contents And Osmolyte Accumulation In Lamina. Conclusion: Taken Together, It Seems That Gharashani And Ghezeluzum, Respectively, Had A Higher And A Lower Capacity To Alleviate Salt Stress Symptoms When Compared To The Other Genotypes. Significance And Impact Of Tiw Study: Salinity Is A Serious Environmental Stress In The Regions Around Urmia Salt Lake And Grapevine Is One Of The Most Economically Important Fruit Crops In Urmia. Therefore, Screening The Native Grape Genotypes For Salt Tolerance And Using The Tolerant Genotypes Directly As Rootstocks Or Producing Hybrids With Desirable Traits Could Be One Of The Improvement Programs For Viticulture In This Area.

Article	Mohammadpour, O//Hassanzadeh, Y//Khodadadi, A//Saghafian, B	Selecting The Best Flood Flow Frequency Model Using Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making	Water Resources Management	Several Criteria Should Be Considered When Selecting A Probability Distribution To Describe Hydrological Data. This Study Examines How Multiple Criteria Can Be Combined To Make The Best Selection. Selection Becomes More Difficult And Subjective When More Than Two Criteria Are Used To Determine The Best Distribution. Under These Conditions, Multi-Criteria Decision-Making Is Necessary. In This Study, 12 Distributions Were Tested And Compared For Flood Frequency Analysis Based On Five Selection Criteria: Root Mean Square Error, Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test Statistic, Relative Average Bias, Modified Anderson-Darling Test, And Deviation In Skewness And Kurtosis. The Comparisons Are Made Using A Multi-Criteria Group Decision-Making (Mcgdm) Based On Ordered Weighted Averaging (Owa). Two Preemptive Goal Programming Models Based On Variance And Entropy Methods For A Predetermined Level Of Optimism By A Group Of Decision-Makers, Determined The Weight Of The Owa Operator. The Model Was Applied To A Case Study Of Mahabad River, A Major River Flowing Into Lake Urmia In Northwestern Iran. A Sensitivity Analysis Of The Results Of Mcgdm Was Done By Changing The Degree Of Optimism Of The Decision-Makers. The Results Of Sensitivity Analysis Showed The Dependence Of The Rankings To The Optimism Degrees Of The Decision-Makers. The 3-Parameter Weibull (Wbl3) And Pearson Type 3 (Pe3) Distributions Had The Best Results For Mahabad River Flood Data. A Monte Carlo Simulation Was Conducted To Test The Ability Of The Models.

Article	Nadiri, Aa//Asghari, Moghaddam, A//Tsai, Ft//Fijani, E	Hydrogeochemical Analysis For Tasuj Plain Aquifer, Iran	Journal Of Earth System Science	This Study Investigated The Hydrogeochemical Processes Of Groundwater In The Tasuj Plain, Iran. The Tasuj Plain Is One Of The 12 Marginal Plains Around Urmia Lake Which Is Currently Under A Critical Ecological Condition. In The Last Decades, The Tasuj Plain Aquifer Suffered From Severe Groundwater Level Declination And Caused Degradation Of Groundwater Quality. To Better Understand Hydrogeochemical Processes In The Tasuj Plain, This Study Adopted Graphical Methods And Multivariate Statistical Techniques To Analyze Groundwater Samples. A Total Of 504 Groundwater Samples Was Obtained From 34 Different Locations (Qanats, Wells, And Springs) Over 12 Years (1997-2009) And Analyzed For 15 Water Quality Parameters. From The Results, The Piper Diagram Indicated Four Groundwater Types And The Stiff Diagram Showed Eight Different Sources Of Groundwater Samples. The Durov Diagram Identified Five Major Hydrogeochemical Processes In The Aquifer. However, Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (Hca) Identified Five Water Types In The Groundwater Samples Because Hca Was Able To Analyze More Chemical And Physical Data Than Graphical Methods. The Hca Result Was Checked By Discriminant Analysis And Found Consistency In All Samples That Were Classified Into Correct Groups. Using Factor Analysis, We Identified Three Factors That Accounted For 81.6% Of The Total Variance Of The Dataset. Based On The High Factor Loadings Of The Variables, Factors 1 And 2 Reflected The Natural Hydrogeochemical Processes And Factor 3 Explained The Effect Of Agricultural Fertilizers And Human Activities In The Tasuj Plain. Dendrograms From 2000 To 2009 Were Studied To Understand The Temporal Variation Of Groundwater Quality. Comparing The Distributions Of Ground-Water Types In 2000 And 2009, We Found That The Mixing Zone Was Expanded. This May Be Due To Artificial Groundwater Recharge In The Recharge Area And The Effect Of Inverse Ion Exchange In The Discharge Area. Indian Academy Of Sciences.

The Ecological Condition Of Lake Urmia Has Degraded During The Past Decade, Due To Climate Change, Human Activities, And Unsustainable Management. The Poor Condition Of The Lake Has Also Affected The Surrounding Wetlands. This Study Analyzes The Land Cover Change Of One Of The Wetlands In The Southern Part Of Lake Urmia, Known As Ghara-Gheshlagh Wetland, In The Period 19892015 Using Post-Classification Change Detection And Machine Learning Image Classification. For This Analysis, Three Landsat Images, Acquired In 1989 (Tm), 2001 (Tm), And 2015 (Landsat-8), Were Used For The Classification And Change Detection. Support Vector Machine Learning Algorithm, A Supervised Learning Method, Is Employed, And Images Are Classified Into Four Main Land Cover Classes Namely Water, Barren, Salty Land, And Agriculture And Grassland. Change Detection Was Carried Out For Pairs Of Years 1989 To 2001 And 2001 Until 2015. The Results Of This Classification Show That There Is A Sharp Increase In The Area Of Salt-Saturated Land As Well As A Decrease In The Area Of Water Resources. Overall Classification Accuracy Obtained Were High For The Individual Years: 1989 (91.48%), 2001 (90.63%), And 2015 (88.6%). Also, The Kappa Coefficients For Individual Maps Were High: 1989 (0.89), 2001 (0.8742), And 2015 (0.84). After That, The Land Cover Change Map Of The Study Area Is Obtained Between 1989 To 2001 And Then 2001 To 2015.

The Present Study Was Conducted To Investigate This Plain, Located In East Azerbaijan Province, Iran, In Terms Of Vulnerability To Contamination. Determining The Most Effective Parameter In The Aquifer Vulnerability Was The Second Aim Of The Study. The Drastic Model Was Used To Assess The Intrinsic Vulnerability Of The Aquifer Applying Seven Hydrogeological Parameters, Including Depth To Water, Net Recharge, Aquifer Media, Soil Media, Topography, Impact Of The Vadose Zone, And Hydraulic Conductivity. Depth To Water Map Was Provided Using 26 Boreholes. Twenty-Seven Drilling Points Were Also Used In Generating Aquifer Media And Impact Of Vadose Zone Maps. After Providing And Ranking All Layers, They Were Multiplied By Appropriate Weights And Overlaid To Produce Vulnerability Map. The Importance Of Each Parameter In The Vulnerability Of The Plain Was Evaluated Through Map Removal And Single-Parameter Sensitivity Analyses. The Drastic Map Indicated That 13.4% Area Is Under Very Low Vulnerability, 55.4% Under Low Vulnerability, 28.6% Under Moderate To Low Vulnerability, And 3% Under Moderate To High Vulnerability. According To The Drastic Map, Only A Small Pocket In West Is Under The Most Vulnerable Zone Due To Sand And Gravel With High Permeability In The Vadose Zone And Low Depth To Water Table. Sensitivity Analysis Proved That The Drastic Index Has The Most Sensitivity To Remove Depth To Water Table. The Verification Of The Drastic Map Using Spatial Distribution Maps Of Total Dissolved Solids (Tds) And Cl, And Water Table In 2002 And 2012 Indicated That The Generated Drastic Map Can Be Acceptable. 2018, Saudi Society For Geosciences.

Article	Rokni, K//Ahmad, A//Selamat, A//Hazini, S	Water Feature Extraction And Change Detection Using Multitemporal Landsat Imagery	Remote Sensing	Lake Urmia Is The 20Th Largest Lake And The Second Largest Hyper Saline Lake (Before September 2010) In The World. It Is Also The Largest Inland Body Of Salt Water In The Middle East. Nevertheless, The Lake Has Been In A Critical Situation In Recent Years Due To Decreasing Surface Water And Increasing Salinity. This Study Modeled The Spatiotemporal Changes Of Lake Urmia In The Period 2000-2013 Using The Multi-Temporal Landsat 5-Tm, 7-Etm+ And 8-Oli Images. In Doing So, The Applicability Of Different Satellite-Derived Indexes Including Normalized Difference Water Index (Ndwi), Modified Ndwi (Mndwi), Normalized Difference Moisture Index (Ndmi), Water Ratio Index (Wri), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (Ndvi), And Automated Water Extraction Index (Awei) Were Investigated For The Extraction Of Surface Water From Landsat Data. Overall, The Ndwi Was Found Superior To Other Indexes And Hence It Was Used To Model The Spatiotemporal Changes Of The Lake. In Addition, A New Approach Based On Principal Components Of Multi-Temporal Ndwi (Ndwi-Pcs) Was Proposed And Evaluated For Surface Water Change Detection. The Results Indicate An Intense Decreasing Trend In Lake Urmia Surface Area In The Period 2000-2013, Especially Between 2010 And 2013 When The Lake Lost About One Third Of Its Surface Area Compared To The Year 2000.

Article	Sadeghi, Sh//Kazemi, Kia, S//Erfanian, M//Movahed, Sms	Identifying Representative Watershed For The Urmia Lake Basin, Iran	Environmental Monitoring And Assessment	Designation Of Representative Watersheds (Rws) As A Reference Area Representing Key Behavior Of The Whole Region Is An Essential Tool To Provide A Time And Cost-Effective Basis For Monitoring Watershed Performance Against Different Driving Forces. It Is More Important In Developing Countries Facing Lack Of Necessary Investments In One Hand And Ever-Increasing Human Interventions And Need To Assess The Outcome Behavior Of The System In Another Hand. However, This Serious Affair Has Been Less Considered Worldwide, In General, And In Developing Countries, In Particular. Therefore, In The Present Study, A Quantitative-Based Method Of Representative Watershed Index (Rwi) With Potential Range From 0 To 100 Has Been Formulated Using Four Important Criteria And Available National-Wide Raster Data Of Elevation (Meter), Slope (%), Rainfall Erosivity Factor (Tmha 1 Cmh 1 ), And Land Use. The Approach Was Then Applied To The Data Prepared For The Unique And Invaluable Global Water Ecosystem Of The Urmia Lake Basin (Ulb), North-Western Iran, As A Case Study. The Input Raster Was Overlaid Via Matrices Programming In The Matrix Laboratory (Matlab) 2016 And Geographic Information System (Gis) 9.3 Software Environments. The Rwis Were Accordingly Computed For 61 Sub-Watersheds Of The Ulb. The Rwis Resulted From Quadri-Partite Dimensional Matrices That Varied From 5.54 To 53.46 With Respective Maximum Dissimilarity And Resemblance With The Entire 61 Study Sub-Watersheds In The Region. However, The Sub-Watershed With Rwi Of 40.65 (No. 57) Was Proposed As The Final Rw For The Whole Ulb Due To Hydrological Independency, Appropriate Locality, And Existence Of Functioning Meteorological And Hydrometric Stations. The Identified Rw Would Be Suggested To Be Considered As The Basis For Future Insight Monitoring And Assessing Environmental Issues For The Region Eventually Leading To An Appropriate Adaptive Watershed Management. 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland Ag.

Samples Of Groundwater, Collected Under Dry And Wet Conditions In Coastal Wells Of Ua, Suggest A Large Degree Of Variability In Both Yree Abundance And Normalized Patterns. Although Weathering Or Water-Rock Interactions (Between The Surface/Groundwater And Rock Samples) Were Predicted To Be The Most Probable Source In Explaining Yrees In Groundwater Samples, Results To The Contrary Indicate That The Groundwater Do Not Inherit Aquifer Rock-Like Yree Signatures In The Study Area, This Might Be Due To The Relative Stability Of Yrees During The Process Of Water-Rock Interactions, Which Suggest That Methods Based On Yrees Can Be Beneficial In Discrimination Of Water Sources. Furthermore, Findings Demonstrated No Significant Relationship Between Ce/Ce* And Salinity (0.08 And 0.05 In Wet And Dry Seasons, Respectively), And Between Eu/Eu* And Salinity (0.1 And 0.04 In Wet And Dry Seasons, Respectively). Dissimilarity Of Patterns Of Yrees In Rock And Water Samples Reveals Yrees As No Conservative Tracers In Determining The Ul Saltwater Intrusion Into Coastal Groundwater. Therefore, The Groundwater Yree Concentrations And Fractionation Patterns In Ua Warrant Controlling By Coastal Aquifer Need To Be Controlled By Other Chemical Weathering, Adsorption, Desorption, And Solution Complexation Reactions.

The Lake Has Been Shrinking In Recent Decades, That Cause Challenges To Economy And Environment Of The Region. It Is Important To Find The Major Contributors To This Disaster. At The Distance Between The Last Hydrometric Station And The Lake, There Are Two Buffer Zones Where Losses And Yields Can Affect The Final Amount Of Flow Reaching To The Lake. In This Study, The Methods Of Determining Each Of The Parameters In The Water Balance Equation Have Been Described. The Term Of Vbuffer Zones In Water Balance Equation Of Urmia Lake Is A Collection Of Unmeasured Positive And Negative Terms. The Results Reveal That The Evaporation Has The Highest Effect Among Other Parameters On The Monthly And Annual Scale, In Estimating The Final Value Of Vbuffer Zones. The Accumulation Input Of Rivers Into The Lake Can Also Affect The Vbuffer Zones During Wet Months. Considering The Monthly Variations Of Rivers Input, Annual Amount Of Vbuffer Zones Is Not A Good Indicator To Study The Monthly Variation Of The Lake Water Level. Therefore, The Time Scale Has An Effective Role In The Estimated Value Of Vbuffer Zones, So Smaller Time Scale (Monthly Or Daily) Is Recommended. Asce.

An Isotopic Correction Was Applied To Samples &Gt, 50% Aragonite, Using The 18O Values Of Calcite-Only Pellets. Absolute Dates Were Derived From U-Th Analyses On Pellets &Gt, 80% Aragonite. The Resultant 18O Record And Sediment Lithofacies Confirm That The Penultimate Glacial Was Cold And Dry, With Pronounced Interstadials At Ca. 150 And &Gt,175 Ka. Deglaciation Began At Ca. 130 Ka, But Climate Was Unstable And Supported A Probable No-Analog Vegetation Assemblage. The Onset Of True Interglacial Conditions Occurred At Ca. 126 Ka. Peak Moisture Conditions Lasted For 5-6 Ka Before The Climate Became Drier, With The Loss Of Some Tree Taxa Towards The End Of The Last Interglacial. A Period Of Greater Moisture Occurred Between 116 And 108 Ka, Overlapping In Timing With Interstadial Conditions Recorded In The Soreq Cave Speleothem Record. In General, Stadial To Interstadial Transitions (Ois 5D-5C, 5B-5A) Are Marked By Decreasing 18O Values And Rising Lake Levels. The Nature Of The Ois 5 To Ois 4 Transition Cannot Be Resolved In This Study Because Of The Loss Of 5 M Of Core And Imprecise Dates. According To The Present Chronology, 18O Values, And Inferred Lake Levels, Arid Conditions Began At 60 Ka And Persisted Until Termination I. Episodic Increases In Moisture, Characterized By Layers Of Aragonite-Rich Pellets, Ostracodes, And The Pollen Of Trees And/Or Aquatic Plants, Occurred During The Last Glacial. Deglaciation Associated With The Late-Glacial Interstadial Began At 14 Ka But Was Interrupted By A Marked Younger Dryas Event That Resulted In Renewed Aridity. The Holocene Began At Approximately 10 Ka. Despite Large Errors In The Chronology, The Overall Timing And Pattern Of Effective Moisture Matches The Record From Soreq Cave, Israel, Suggesting That The Two Regions Were Climatically In-Phase. 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Article	Tarebari, H//Javid, Ah//Mirbagheri, Sa//Fahmi, H	Multi-Objective Surface Water Resource Management Considering Conflict Resolution And Utility Function Optimization	Water Resources Management	In The Present Research, A Multi-Objective Model Is Developed For Surface Water Resource Management In The River Basin Area Which Is Connected To The Lake. This Model Considers Different Components Of Sustainable Water Resource Management Including Economic, Social And Environmental Aspects, And Simultaneously Tries To Resolve Conflicts Between Different Stakeholders By Means Of Non-Symmetric Nash Bargaining, Which Is Linked To The Multi-Objective Optimization Method. This Study Proposes A New Methodology To Improve Nash Conflict Resolution Through Finding The Optimum Degree Of The Utility Function. The Proposed Model Is Examined In The Zarrineh River Basin In Iran. The Results Show That The Amount Of Available Resources Or Volume Of Reservoirs Play A Significant Role In Determining The Optimal Degree Of The Utility Function And Efficiency Of The Proposed Method In Such A Way That The Higher Amount Of Resources Or The Larger Reservoirs Will Result In The Higher Optimal Degree Of The Utility Function. In The Proposed Multi-Objective Model, Two Different Amounts Of Surface Water Inflow Are Considered. The First Assumed Amount Is The Long-Term Average Flow Rate And The Second One Is Equal To 80% Of The First Mode, Which Is Reduced Based On The Estimated Impacts Of Climate Changes. This Multi-Objective Allocation Model Could Supply 100 And 97.5% Of The Environmental Demand Of Lake Urmia In The First And Second Situations, Respectively. 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

Article	Tarebari, H//Javid, Ah//Mirbagheri, Sa//Fahmi, H	Optimal Water Allocation By Equilibrating Between Agricultural And Environmental Sectors In River Basins	Applied Ecology And Environmental Research	The Aim Of This Study Was To Optimal Surface Water Resource Management In The River-Lake Connected Basins Which Are Faced With Water Scarcity. In These Regions, Meeting The Water Demands Of Stakeholders Along With Supplying The Environmental Water Requirements Are Critical And Controversial Issues. In This Research, A Multi-Objective Water Allocation Model Which Addresses The Socio-Economic And Environmental Objectives Was Developed, And A New Simple Method Has Been Introduced For Equilibrating Between The Sectors Among Which There Are Main Conflicts. The Proposed Method Was Examined In The Zarrineh And Simineh Rivers Basins In Iran. These Basins Are The Main Surface Water Suppliers Of The Lake Urmia Which Is Facing A Shrinkage Challenge. As The Agricultural Sector Is The Main Water User In The Lake Urmia Basin, So There Are Significant Conflicts Between This Sector And Lake Urmias Environment. Hence, The Equilibrium Status Is Obtained Between These Two Stakeholders Through Drawing The Graph Of Their Utility Functions Versus Risk Parameter In The Compromise Programming Technique. The Proposed Model Can Supply The Domestic, Industrial And Agricultural Demands 92.3, 100 And 60.8% Respectively. Moreover, The Ecological Requirements Of The Rivers Are Supplied Totally, And That Of Lake Urmia Amounts To 67.45%. 2018, Alki Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

Article	Tisseuil, C//Roshan, Gh, R//Nasrabadi, T//Asadpour, Ga	Statistical Modeling Of Future Lake Level Under Climatic Conditions, Case Study Of Urmia Lake (Iran)	International Journal Of Environmental Research	The Present Research Focuses On The Changes Of Urmia Lake Level. For This Purpose, Two Time Scales Have Been Considered. The Trend Changes Of Temperature, Precipitation Rate And Quantitative Values Of Climate Type For The Observational Period From 1968 To 2011 (Past Scale) And From 2011 To 2100 (Future Scale) Have Been Analyzed. General Circulation Model (Gcm) Is Considered For Simulating The Values Of The Future Meteorological Components, And Statistical Models Have Been Used For Modeling The Lake'S Level In Future Decades. One Of The Most Significant Results Achieved For The Future Decades Is The Increase Of The Lake'S Temperature For Around 1.5 Degrees Centigrade Till 2100 In Comparison With The Long-Term Average Of 1961 To 1990. Furthermore, The Values Extracted From Precipitation Rate And Climate Type Of The Zone Also Indicate A Remarkable Decrease Of Quantitative Values In The Future Decades. Accordingly, The Climate Type Extracted For The Year 2100 With Numeric Value Of Around 17.75 Will Be Entered A New Phase Called Arid Climate For The First Time In Recent Decades. The Lake Surface Area Is Diminished From 5650 Square Kilometers In 1998 To About 2005 Square Kilometers In 2010. According To The Results Achieved By Statistical Models And Time Series, If This Trend Continues, The Lake Level Will Be Reduced Around 3 More Meters In 2100.

Article	Torabi, Haghighi, A//Fazel, N//Hekmatzadeh, Aa//Klve, B	Analysis Of Effective Environmental Flow Release Strategies For Lake Urmia Restoration	Water Resources Management	Saline Lakes Have Diminished Considerably Due To Large-Scale Irrigation Projects Throughout The World. Environmental Flow (Ef) Release From Upstream Reservoirs Could Help Conserve And Restore These Lakes. However, Experiences From Regions Lacking Environmental Legislation Or With Insufficient Water Resources Management Show That, Despite Ef Allocation, Farmers Tend To Use All Available Water For Agriculture. In This Study, We Employed A New Method For Designing Environmental Flow Release Strategies To Restore Desiccated Terminal Lakes In Arid And Semi-Arid Regions With Intensive Cultivation Within The Catchment. The Novelty Of The Method Is That It Takes Into Account Farmers Water Use Behavior And The Natural Flow Regime In Upstream Systems To Design An Optimum Monthly Ef Release Strategy For Reservoirs. We Applied The Method To The Water Resource System Of Lake Urmia, Once The Largest Saline Lake In The Middle East And Now One Of The Most Endangered Saline Lakes In The World. The Analysis Showed That The Ef Released Is Exploited By Lowland Farmers Before Reaching Lake Urmia And That Inflow To The Lake From Some Rivers Has Decreased By Up To 80%. We Propose A New Ef Release Strategy That Requires A Considerable Change In Practice Whereby Water Is Released In The Shortest Possible Time (According To Reservoir Outlet Capacity) During The Period Of Lowest Irrigation Demand In Winter. Restoring The Lake To Minimum Ecological Level Would Require 2.43.4Km3 Ef Allocation By Different Methods Of Release Based On The Recent Condition (20022011) Of The Lake. 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., Part Of Springer Nature.

There Has Not Been Any Studied Concerning Of How Much Dust Is Emitted And Transported In This Area. The Aim Of This Research Study Was To Measure The Amount Of Dust Suspended Particles Flux In The Lake Area. To Implement This Objective, 56 Aeolian Dust Samplers Were Mounted At 0.15, 0.5, 1 And 2 M Heights In 14 Different Poles And The Suspended Particles Flux Was Measured During One Year Period. The Data Showed That The Flux In March, June, And October Accounted For 53% Of The Annual Total. The Suspended Particles Flux Decrease Rapidly With Increasing Height Of Soil Surface. The Obtained Data Showed That The Suspended Particles Flux Is Strongly Correlated With The Amount Of Monthly Precipitation And Mean Wind Velocity But There Was No Significant Relationship Between Monthly Suspended Particles Flux And Speed Of The Strongest Wind. The Result Also Showed That The Wind Direction Did Not Influence Flux. Different Heights Of The Soil Surface, Sampling Times And Sampling Sites Had Significant (P 0.01) Effects On Flux. 2018, Alki Kft., Budapest, Hungary.

Article	Zarghami, M//Safari, N//Szidarovszky, F//Islam, S	Nonlinear Interval Parameter Programming Combined With Cooperative Games: A Tool For Addressing Uncertainty In Water Allocation Using Water Diplomacy Framework	Water Resources Management	This Paper Shows The Utility Of A New Interval Cooperative Game Theory As An Effective Water Diplomacy Tool To Resolve Competing And Conflicting Needs Of Water Users From Different Sectors Including Agriculture, Domestic, Industry And Environment. Interval Parameter Programming Is Applied In Combination With Cooperative Game Theoretic Concepts Such As Shapley Values And The Nucleolus To Provide Mutually Beneficial Solutions For Water Allocation Problems Under Uncertainty. The Allocation Problem Consists Of Two Steps: Water Resources Are Initially Allocated To Water Users Based On The Nash Bargaining Model And The Achieved Nonlinear Interval Parameter Model Is Solved By Transforming It Into A Problem With A Deterministic Weighted Objective Function. Water Amounts And Net Benefits Are Reallocated To Achieve Efficient Water Usage Through Net Benefit Transfers. The Net Benefit Reallocation Is Done By The Application Of Different Cooperative Game Theoretical Methods. Then, The Optimization Problem Is Solved By Linear Interval Programming And By Converting It Into A Problem With Two Deterministic Objective Functions. The Suggested Model Is Then Applied To The Zarrinehrud Sub-Basin, Within Urmia Lake Basin In Northwestern Iran. Findings Suggest That A Reframing Of The Problem Using Cooperative Strategies Within The Context Of Water Diplomacy Framework - Creating Flexibility In Water Allocation Using Mutual Gains Approach - Provides Better Outcomes For All Competing Users Of Water. 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The Aim Of The Present Study Is To Report The Relationship Between Urmia Lake'S Drying And The Corrosion And Scaling Potential Of Groundwater Used As Drinking Water During The Spring And Summer Of 2015. Groundwater Samples Were Collected From All Of The Catchments Of The Urmia Lake Basin, And The Characteristics Of The Water Were Used To Determine The Corrosive And Scaling Indices Using The Langelier Saturation Index And The Ryznar Stability Index. The Results Showed That The Total Dissolved Solids Measurement Of The Samples Collected From The Islands Of Urmia Lake Was Higher Than The Maximum Value Of The Standard Level. In Addition, The Hardness In 36% Of The Zones Was Higher Than That Of The Maximum Suggested Level. The Concentration Of Calcium Was Lower Than That Of The Standard, But The Rest Of The Parameters Were In The Standard Level Range. Also, The Results Showed That The Water Of The Urmia Lake Basin Tends To Be Very Scaling And Corrosive. In Order To Control The Corrosion And Scaling Caused By Groundwater Drawn From The Catchments Around Urmia Lake, Measures Should Be Taken To Prevent Urmia Lake'S Drying And To Manage The Groundwater Around This Area. It Is Also Suggested That A Laboratory Study Regarding The Condition Of The Distribution System Be Carried Out To Adjust The Effective Parameters, Such As The Ph. 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Dava Gz Is One Of The Few Settlements In This Area That Has Been Excavated Using Modern Techniques, And Has Provided New Information On The Development Of The Communities In The Lake Urmia Basin From The Sixth To The Fourth Millennia Bce (54003700/3600 Bce), Including The Neolithic/Transitional Chalcolithic (Period Ia), The Early Chalcolithic (Dalma=Period Ib) And The Late Chalcolithic (Pisdeli=Lc1=Period Ii, Chaff-Faced Ware Horizon=Lc2=Period Iii) Phases. The Analysis Of The Settlement'S Material Culture Also Enables Some Preliminary Conclusions Regarding The Interactions Between The Groups Situated North Of Lake Urmia And The Contemporary Caucasian Cultures, As Well As With Those Located Farther West And South, In Eastern Anatolia And In The Syro-Mesopotamian Region. The Characterization Of 126 Artifacts From Three Periods Using A Portable Xrf Machine Indicates Throughout The Phases That Changes Occurred In Procurement Activity. In The Earlier Phases (Transitional Chalcolithic And Dalma), Procurement More Closely Resembles A Polysource Pattern, Dominated By One Main Obsidian Outcrop And Complemented By Several, Less Represented Sources Of That Raw Material. This Pattern However Appears To Change In The Later Phase Of The Site'S Occupation (Lc2/Cfw) Where A Clear Domination Of One Obsidian Source Is Represented. This Development Could Be Connected To A Disruption In Procurement Networks And Most Probably In Transhumance Patterns As Well. 2018 Elsevier Ltd	Dava Gz, Nw Iran, Obsidian, Prehistoric Trade, Provenance, Transhumant, Xrf, Na	10.1016/J.JASREP.2018.06.022	756-767	Scopus	20	2018

Article	Ahmadebrahimpour, E//Aminnejad, B//Khalili, K	Assessing Future Drought Conditions Under A Changing Climate: A Case Study Of The Lake Urmia Basin In Iran	Water Science And Technology: Water Supply	This Study Was Conducted To Assess The Impacts Of Climate Change On Drought Over The Lake Urmia Basin, Iran. Drought Events For 20112040, 20412070, And 20712100 Were Analyzed Based On The Standardized Precipitation Index (Spi) And The Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (Spei) And Were Compared With The Adopted Baseline Period (19762005). The Spi And Spei Were Calculated Using The Precipitation And Temperatures Obtained From The Second-Generation Canadian Earth System Model (Canesm2) Under Representative Concentration Pathway (Rcp) 2.6 And Rcp 8.5 As Optimistic And Pessimistic Scenarios Respectively. The Results Of Spi Analyses Revealed That Under Rcp 2.6 The Frequency Of Droughts Is Almost Constant While Under Rcp 8.5 Drought Frequency Increased Especially In The Period 20712100. The Calculated Sepi Under Both Scenarios And During All Future Periods Predict That The Frequency And Duration Of Droughts Will Increase. Generally, The Difference Between The Spi And Spei Is Related To The Input To Each Index. Spi Is Solely Based On Precipitation While The Spei Accounts For Both Precipitation And Potential Evapotranspiration (Pet). Under Global Warming And Changing Climate, The Significant Role Of Pet Was Highlighted. It Was Concluded That The Spei Outperformed The Spi For Drought Studies Under A Changing Climate.

Assessing The Precipitation Data Of Global Datasets Indicate That The Major Error In Precipitation Of Global Datasets Is Bias Error Which Means That They Can Recognise The Behaviour Of Precipitation Time Series But There Is A Difference In Estimation Of Precipitation Amount. To Diminish The Bias Error, Bias Correction (Bc) Was Done Before Evaluating The Datasets In Drought Monitoring. The Results Indicated That Gpcc Is The Most Suitable Dataset Over The Study Area For Drought Studies. In Addition, Results Revealed That There Is No Significant Difference Between Original And Bc Data In Drought Monitoring. For Example, In Nine-Month Spi, The Critical Success Index (Csi) For Original Cru And Cru-Bc Were Equal To 71 And 76%, Respectively, And The Gpcc And Udel In Both Original And Bc Versions Were Equal To 88 And 55%, Respectively. Also, It Can Be Claim That The Bias Error Is Not Important In Drought Studies Due To The Fact That During Calculation Of Spi, Standardisation Process Will Remove Bias Significantly.

Conference Paper	Alavipanah, Sk//Amiri, R//Khodaei, K	The Use Of Spectral Signatures In Extracting Information From Water Quality Parameters In The Lake Urmia, Iran	International Archives Of The Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing And Spatial Information Sciences - Isprs Archives	Lake Urmia, The Second Hypersaline Lake In The World, Because Of Its Climatic And Economical Importance Has Created A Populated Region In Iran, And In Return Its Fragile Ecosystem Has Been Affected By The Presence Of This Growing Population. The Economical And Social Importance Of The Connection Between The Population Centers In Both Sides Of The Lake Has Encouraged The Construction Of A Causeway, Which Consequently Has Been Divided The Lake Into Northern And Southern Parts. Thus, The Navigational And Hydrological Links Have Been Limited To A Gap. The Aim Of This Paper Is To Study The Impacts Of The Division Of The Lake In Water Quality Parameters Such As Salinity And Sediment Concentration And The Efficiency Of The Implemented Gap In Connecting Two Parts Using Remotely Sensed Data. The Multitemporal Landsat Images Were Used In Order To Observe The Spatial And Temporal Variations Of Water Quality Parameters. The Preliminary Examinations Of The Image Data Have Shown That Some Patterns Could Be Detected Through Using Image Composites. To Examine The Spatial Variability Of The Parameters, Certain Transects Were Drawn Over Reflective And Thermal Bands And Then The Spectral Signatures Were Analyzed. Some Changes In The Spectral Behavior Of Water Were Studied By The Selection Of Homogenous Regions Of The Lake From Both Sides Of The Causeway. The Images Were Closely Examined To Follow The Changes Using Image Processing Techniques. The Study Of Spectral Signatures Of The Selected Regions Of Different Times Revealed A Significant Difference Between Two Sides Of The Causeway Having Increased Spatial Variability. Thus, It Can Be Concluded That The Observed Differences Of Two Sections In Understudy Parameters Could Be Attributed To The Blocking Effect Of The Causeway And Inefficiency Of The Gap In Preserving The Link. The Crucial Importance Of The Lake In The Region And Its Endangered Ecosystem Prompts For Continuous Study And Monitoring Of The Parameters Using Remote Sensing. 2007 International Society For Photogrammetry And Remote Sensing.

Article	Alizade, Govarchin, Ghale, Y//Altunkaynak, A//Unal, A	Investigation Anthropogenic Impacts And Climate Factors On Drying Up Of Urmia Lake Using Water Budget And Drought Analysis	Water Resources Management	The Water Level Of Urmia Lake, The Largest Inland Lake In Iran With Maximum Water Surface Area Of About 6000Km 2 , Has Been Shrinking For The Last Two Decades. Although A Number Of Study Have Been Performed To Determine Drought Condition And Coastline Changes Of Urmia Lake, There Has Not Been A Detailed Study To Distinguish Anthropogenic Effects From Climate Impacts On The Drying Of Urmia Lake. In This Study, Water Budget Of Urmia Lake And The Intensity Of Drought In The Basin Were Analyzed In The Period From 1985 To 2010 And A New Hypothesis Is Proposed To Quantify Anthropogenic And Climate Impacts In Reducing The Volume Of Urmia Lake. The Results Of This Study Indicate That Human Impacts On The Lake And Its Basin Are More Important Than Climate Factors. Though Previous Studies Assumed That Ground Water Output From Urmia Lake Is Negligible, The Results Of This Study Show The Presence Of Significant Groundwater Seepage From Urmia Lake. Major Changes In The Variables That Reduced The Water Level Of Urmia Lake Were Observed Since 1998. Anthropogenic Impacts And Climate Factors Have Roughly 80% And 20% Effects On The Drying Up Of Urmia Lake, Respectively. Hence, The First Step To Recover Urmia Lake Could Be The Revision Of Management Surface Water, Operation Of Dams And Groundwater Resources. The Second Step Could Be The Review And Classification Of Agricultural Products Grown In The Region In Terms Of Water Consumption And Teach Local People The Best Practice Methods For Irrigation. 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

In Recent Years, Most Of The Lake Has Been Rendered To Unusable Lands. Drought And Rapid Increase In Agricultural Activities Are The Most Important Reasons Behind The Shrinkage Of The Lake. In This Study, Hydro-Climatic Data, Landsat Satellite Images And Image Processing Techniques Were Used To Detect The Spatio-Temporal Land Cover Changes And Salinization Progress In Urmia Lake Basin (Ulb) Between 1975 And 2019. Increasing The Area Of Irrigated Lands From 1265 Km2 In 1975 To 5525 Km2 In 2011 In Contrast To Decreasing The Water Surface Area Of Ul From 5982 Km2 In 1995 To 586 Km2 In 2014 And Extension Of Salinization In The Basin Are The Most Important And Thoughtful Results Of This Study. Even The Agricultural Lands In The Regions Close To The Lake Have Been Affected By This Environmental Problem. The Climatic Conditions Have Gradually Improved After 2014 And The Government Has Released More Water From Dams To The Lake. On The Other Hand, The Area Of Irrigated Lands Has Gradually Decreased By 12% In The Same Period. As A Result Of These Positive Changes, The Water Surface Area Of The Lake Has Gradually Increased Over 1000 Km2. Based On The Results Of This Study, Both Anthropogenic And Climatic Factors Have Played A Positive Role In Ul Restoration. Improvement Of Agricultural Methods And Providing A Sustainable Agricultural Water Management System Under A Changing Climate Can Play The Most Effective Role In The Lake Rehabilitation. 2019 Elsevier B.V.

In This Study, Three Strategies Including Irrigation Depth Reduction, Changing Planting Dates And Crop Rotation In Crop Patterns Of Urmia City Were Assessed For Improvement Of Water Productivity To Mitigate The Crisis Of Lake Urmia. For This Purpose, The Aquacrop Simulation Model Was Applied. The Effects Of The Three Strategies Were Investigated With Four Indicators: (I) Total Water Productivity (Twp), (Ii) Economic Water Productivity (Ewp), (Iii) Farmers' Benefit (Fb), (Iv) Dry Yield (Dy). The Results Showed That A 60% Reduction Of Current Irrigation Depth For Winter Wheat, Winter Barley, Forage Maize And Tomato And A 40% Reduction For Sunflower Substantially Increased Twp And Ewp Without Considerable Reduction In Dy And Fb. Early Planting Dates For Autumn Planting Crops (Wheat And Barley) And Delaying Planting Dates For Spring Planting Crops Led To A Decreased Irrigation Requirement And Increased Benefit From Rainfall. For The Autumn Planting Pattern, Selecting Winter Barley Reduced Water Consumption By 2170M 3 Ha 1 Compared To Winter Wheat, And For The Spring Planting Pattern, Selecting Forage Maize Decreased Water Consumption By 2080 And 3150M 3 Ha 1 Compared To Sunflower And Tomato, Respectively. 2018 John Wiley &Amp, Sons, Ltd. 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

In General, Regional Droughts Are Affected By General Circulation Of The Atmosphere (At Large-Scale) And Regional Natural Factors, Including The Topography, Natural Lakes, The Position Relative To The Center And The Path Of The Ocean Currents (At Small-Scale), And They Don'T Cover The Exact Same Effects In A Wide Area. Therefore, Drought Severity-Area-Frequency (S-A-F) Curve Investigation Is An Essential Task To Develop Decision Making Rule For Regional Drought Management. This Study Developed The Copula-Based Joint Probability Distribution Of Drought Severity And Percent Of Area Under Drought Across The Lake Urmia Basin, Iran. To Do This End, One-Month Standardized Precipitation Index (Spi) Values During The 19712013 Were Applied Across 24 Rainfall Stations In The Study Area. Then, Seven Copula Functions Of Various Families, Including Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, Joe, Galambos, Plackett And Normal Copulas, Were Used To Model The Joint Probability Distribution Of Drought Severity And Drought Area. Using Aic, Bic And Rmse Criteria, The Frank Copula Was Selected As The Most Appropriate Copula In Order To Develop The Joint Probability Distribution Of Severity-Percent Of Area Under Drought Across The Study Area. Based On The Frank Copula, The Drought S-A-F Curve For The Study Area Was Derived. The Results Indicated That Severe/Extreme Drought And Non-Drought (Wet) Behaviors Have Affected The Majority Of Study Areas (Lake Urmia Basin).

The Analysis Of Trend Variations Of This Index Can Be Used To Determine Appropriate Strategies In Planning And Management Of Water Resources. In This Paper, The Trend Variations Of Monthly And Annual Et0 In Urmia Lake Basin, Located In The Northwest Of Iran, Have Been Analyzed Using Data From 14 Synoptic Stations In The Study Area. Regarding The Significant Effect Of Autocorrelation Coefficients With Different Lags On Trend Variations Of Et0, This Paper Has Resorted To Modified Mannkendall Test Via Eliminating The Significance Effect Of Autocorrelation Coefficients With Different Lags To Analyze The Trend Variations. Furthermore, Theilsen Estimator Has Been Used To Determine The Slope Of Trend Line Of Et0. The Results Indicated An Increasing Trend In Et0 Values At All The Studied Stations. Having Used The Modified Mannkendall Test, The Values Of Significant Increasing (Positive) Trend, Which Were Estimated Using Common Mannkendall Test, Dramatically Decreased. As Such, The Values Of Only 7 Stations Have Been Significant At 95% Level. The Results Confirmed The Need For Eliminating The Significance Effect Of Autocorrelation Coefficients With Different Lags To Determine And Evaluate The Trend Of Hydrological Variables. 2015, Springer-Verlag Wien.

Article	Amiri, V//Nakhaei, M//Lak, R	Using Radon-222 And Radium-226 Isotopes To Deduce The Functioning Of A Coastal Aquifer Adjacent To A Hypersaline Lake In Nw Iran	Journal Of Asian Earth Sciences	This Study Aims To Assess The Hydrogeochemistry Of Coastal Groundwater, The Occurrence Of 222 Rn And 226 Ra, And Their Isotopic Response To Salinity And Associated Chemical Compositions Of Groundwater In The Coastal Urmia Aquifer (Ua) At The Western Side Of Urmia Lake (Ul). The Results Of The Pca Show That 87.3% Of Groundwater Chemistry Changes Are Controlled By Six Principal Components. The Interaction Between Groundwater And Coastal Igneous And Metamorphic Rocks In Eastern Areas (Next To The Ul) Results In Complex Hydrogeochemical Conditions Than Western Areas. Based On Correlation Of U And Salinity, Some Coastal Samples Display Conservative And The Others Non-Conservative Behaviors. Differed From Most Previous Studies, 226 Ra And 222 Rn Concentrations In Coastal Groundwater Samples Of Ua Do Not Show A Good Correlation With Salinity. Given 10% Of Groundwater 222 Rn Is Originated From Host Rocks, The Radon Concentrations Recorded In The Coastal Groundwater Samples Are Relatively In Range That Can Effectively Be Supplied By The Local Rocks (549Bq/L). Results Of Different Chemical And Isotopic Parameters In This Area Indicate That There Is No Direct Connection Between Fresh Groundwater And Ul Saltwater. This Is Because That The Hard And Thick Salty Layer In The Lakebed Acts As An Impermeable Barrier To Prevent The Underground Hydraulic Connection. Results Show That Removing The Salty Layer Of Ul As An Option To Progress In Rehabilitation Program Of This Lake May Result In More Hydraulic Connection Between The Lake And Groundwater Resources In Some Areas. 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Geochemical Modeling, Salinity, Stable And Radioactive Isotopes, Uranium Speciation, Urmia Aquifer, Urmia Lake, Chemical Composition, Coastal Aquifer, Hydrogeochemistry, Hypersaline Environment, Radium Isotope, Radon Isotope, Speciation (Chemistry), Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1016/J.JSEAES.2017.07.015	128-147	Scopus	147	2017
Article	Arabsahebi, R//Voosoghi, B//Tourian, Mj	An Estimation Of Tropospheric Corrections Using Gps And Synoptic Data: Improving Urmia Lake Water Level Time Series From Jason-2 And Saral/Altika Satellite Altimetry	Advances In Space Research	Tropospheric Correction Is One Of The Most Important Corrections In Satellite Altimetry Measurements. Tropospheric Wet And Dry Path Delays Have Strong Dependence On Temperature, Pressure And Humidity. Tropospheric Layer Has Particularly High Variability Over Coastal Regions Due To Humidity, Wind And Temperature Gradients. Depending On The Extent Of Water Body And Wind Conditions Over An Inland Water, Wet Tropospheric Correction (Wtc) Is Within The Ranges From A Few Centimeters To Tens Of Centimeters. Therefore, An Extra Care Is Needed To Estimate Tropospheric Corrections On The Altimetric Measurements Over Inland Waters. This Study Assesses The Role Of Tropospheric Correction On The Altimetric Measurements Over The Urmia Lake In Iran. For This Purpose, Four Types Of Tropospheric Corrections Have Been Used: (I) Microwave Radiometer (Mwr) Observations, (Ii) Tropospheric Corrections Computed From Meteorological Models, (Iii) Gps Observations And (Iv) Synoptic Station Data. They Have Been Applied To Jason-2 Track No. 133 And Saral/Altika Track No. 741 And 356 Corresponding To 117153 And The 2334 Cycles, Respectively. In Addition, The Corresponding Measurements Of Pistach And Peachi, Include New Retracking Method And An Innovative Wet Tropospheric Correction, Have Also Been Used. Our Results Show That Gps Observation Leads To The Most Accurate Tropospheric Correction. The Results Obtained From The Pistach And Peachi Projects Confirm Those Obtained With The Standard Sgdr, I.E., The Role Of Gps In Improving The Tropospheric Corrections. It Is Inferred That The Mwr Data From Jason-2 Mission Is Appropriate For The Tropospheric Corrections, However The Saral/Altika One Is Not Proper Because Jason-2 Possesses An Enhanced Wtc Near The Coast. Furthermore, Virtual Stations Are Defined For Assessment Of The Results In Terms Of Time Series Of Water Level Height (Wlh). The Results Show That Gps Tropospheric Corrections Lead To The Most Accurate Wlh Estimation For The Selected Virtual Stations, Which Improves The Accuracy Of The Obtained Wlh Time Series By About 5%. 2018 Cospar	Inland Water, Peachi, Pistach, Satellite Altimetry, Tropospheric Correction, Aneroid Altimeters, Coastal Zones, Geodetic Satellites, Global Positioning System, Lakes, Microwave Devices, Office Buildings, Time Series, Water Levels, Inland Waters, Meteorological Models, Microwave Radiometers, Peachi, Pistach, Satellite Altimetry, Strong Dependences, Virtual Stations, Troposphere	10.1016/J.ASR.2018.02.013	2406-2417	Scopus	61	2018
Article	Arkian, F//Nicholson, Se//Ziaie, B	Meteorological Factors Affecting The Sudden Decline In Lake Urmias Water Level	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	Lake Urmia, In Northwest Iran, Is The Second Most Saline Lake In The World. During The Past Two Decades, The Level Of Water Has Markedly Decreased. In This Paper, Climate Of The Lake Region Is Investigated By Using Data From Four Meteorological Stations Near The Lake. The Data Include Climatic Parameters Such As Temperature, Precipitation, Humidity, Wind Speed, Sunshine Hours, Number Of Rain Days, And Evaporation. Climate Around The Lake Is Examined By Way Of Climate Classification In The Periods Before And After The Reduction In Water Level. Rainfall In The Lake Catchment Is Also Evaluated Using Both Gauge And Satellite Data. The Results Show A Significant Decreasing Trend In Mean Annual Precipitation And Wind Speed And An Increasing Trend In Annual Average Temperature And Sunshine Hours At The Four Stations. Precipitation And Wind Speed Have Decreased By 37Mm And 2.7M/S, Respectively, And The Mean Annual Temperature And Sunshine Hours Have Increased By 1.4C And 41.6Days, Respectively, Over These Six Decades. Only The Climate Of The Tabriz Region Is Seen To Have Significantly Changed, Going From Semiarid To Arid. Gauge Records And Satellite Data Show A Large-Scale Decreasing Trend In Rainfall Since 1995. The Correlation Between Rainfall And Year-To-Year Changes In Lake Level Is 0.69 Over The Period 1965 To 2010. The Relationship Is Particularly Strong From The Early 1990S To 2005. This Suggests That Precipitation Has Played An Important Role In The Documented Decline Of The Lake. 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.

The Objective Of The Present Study Was To Characterize The Chitin And Chitosan Obtained From The Shells Of Artemia Urmiana Cysts And To Compare These To Two Commercially Available Products Purified By Chemical And Biological Methods. The Shells Of Artemia Cysts Were Obtained From Urmia Lake, Iran. We Found A High Yield Of Chitin In Comparison To Other Sources, With A Lower Percentage Of Residual Materials. We Also Found The Efficiency Of Conversion Of Chitin To Chitosan To Be 20 10% Using The Biological Method Described Herein. The High Molecular Weight, Crystalinity, And Lower Degree Of Deacetylation (D.D.A.) Of These Biopolymers Obtained By The Biological Method Were Other Characteristics Associated With The Use Of Artemia Urmiana Cyst Shells As The Source. The Results Of Analytical Methods Indicate That Both Chitin And Chitosan From Empty Artemia Cysts Compared Favourably With Two Commercially Available Products. In Conclusion, We Suggest That One Should Consider Using The Biotechnological Approach Taken Here, Instead Of Resorting To Commonly Used Chemical Methods, In Order To Reduce Environmental Pollution But Still Obtain High Quality Products. 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.

Paenibacillus Species Are Well-Known Polysaccharide Hydrolyzing Bacteria. However, Paenibacillus Alginolyticus And Paenibacillus Sp. Xd Are The Only Species In The Genus Which Are Now Known To Degrade Xanthan. Objectives: Complete Biodegradation Of The Xanthan Exopolysaccharide Is A Rarely Found Capability Among Microorganisms. The Aim Of This Study Is To Survey Xanthanase Producing Bacteria With An Appropriate Bioactivity For The Biopolymer Degradation Under Different Environmental Conditions. Materials And Methods: The Bacteria Were Isolated Based On Viscosity Reduction Of The Xanthan Solution. Bacterial Isolates Were Identified Using Rep-Pcr (Repetitive Element-Based Genomic Fingerprinting) And 16S Rdna Sequencing. Xanthanases Were Characterized By Measuring Their Activity At Different Temperatures, Ph Values, And Nacl Concentrations. Degradation Of Other Polysaccharides And Xanthan Degradation Products Were Investigated Based On The Screening Plate Method And Tlc (Thin-Layer Chromatography), Respectively. Results:Six Isolates From Different Paenibacillus Species With A Complete Xanthan Degrading Capability Were Isolated From Urmia Lake. Phylogenetic Analysis Placed These Strains Within The Genus Paenibacillus With The Closest Relatives That Were Found To Be P. Nanensis, P. Phyllosphaerae, P. Agaridevorans, P. Agarexedens, And P. Taohuashanense. These Isolates Displayed Different Levels Of The Xanthan Biodegradation Activity In Temperatures Ranging From 15 To 55 C And Ph Values From 4 To 11. Xanthanolytic Activity Was Generally Prevented In Presence Of Nacl (&Gt, 0.1 Mol.L-1). Furthermore, The Isolated Paenibacillus Spp. Could Degrade Several Other Polysaccharides Including Xylan, Cmc (Carboxymethyl Cellulose), Starch, Alginate, And Pectin. Conclusion: Novel Strains Of The Six Different Paenibacillus Species That Were Introduced In The Present Study Are Able To Produce Xanthanases With Interesting Characteristics.

Lake Urmia In Iran Is Plagued By Natural And Anthropogenic Driving Forces And Its Water Level Has Fallen By About 3M Below The Minimum Ecological Water Level. To Deal With The Divergent Interests And Multiple Objectives Associated With The Lakes Water Resources, A Multidisciplinary And Flexible Approach Is Then Required. The Present Research Phases Included: (1) Determining The Effective Internal And External Factors Along With Formulating Strategic Alternatives For Reviving The Lakes Water Resources Via Strengthweaknessopportunitythreat (Swottows) Matrix, (2) Prioritizing The Alternatives According To Sustainable Development Criteria Via Extended Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (Fahp) Technique, And (3) Applying Sensitivity Analysis To Monitor The Robustness Of The Ranking. Representatives Of The Stakeholders, Managers And Experts Participated In The Process Of Decision Making. To Consider The Different Viewpoints And The Overall Possibility Distributions Of Fuzzy Numbers, Three Ranking Procedures Were Developed Through The Extended Fahp, Reflecting Neutral, Optimistic, And Pessimistic Viewpoints. According To The Final Prioritization, Human Resources Management And Promotion Of Stakeholders Participation Stood Superior To The Other Strategic Alternatives. In This Framework, Swottows Analysis Performed As An Appropriate Prerequisite To Formulate Practical Strategies For Supporting Of A Sustainable Development Vision.

It Becomes More Complicated In Endorheic Basins That Consist Of Separate Land And Water Phases. The Application Of Remotely-Sensed Data Is One Solution In This Regard. The Present Study Addresses This Issue And Develops A Modeling Framework To Evaluate A Water Budget Based On Remotely-Sensed Data For Endorheic Basins. To Explore The Methodology, Lake Urmia Basin Was Selected As A Case Study. The Lake Water Level Has Declined Steeply Since 1995 And Stakeholders Have Agreed To Allocate 3100 Mcm Of Water Per Year To The Lake. This Makes It Necessary To Monitor River Inflow Into The Lake To Fulfill The Agreement. Gauging Stations Have Been Employed Around The Lake, But They Could Not Account For Shortages Such As Water Uptake Below The Stations. To Do This, Separate Water Budgets For The Water Body And The Land Were Required. More Specifically, It Was Necessary To Estimate Actual Evapotranspiration (Et A ) From Freshwater (E F ) And Saltwater (E S ) Estimated Using The Sebal Model. Different Methods Were Applied To Estimate Soil Moisture, Groundwater Exploitation, And Surface-Groundwater Inflow Into The Lake. A Comparison Of The Observed And Estimated Amounts Showed Good Agreement. For Instance, The Coefficient Of Determination For The Observed/Reported And Estimated Et A And E F Were 0.83 And 0.84, Respectively. The Average Annual Inflow Was Estimated To Be 2.2 Bcm/Year For 20022008 Using The Rs Model, Which Is About 84% Of The Total Inflow From The Last Recording Stations Before The Lake And Shows Influence Of Water Exploitation After These Stations. Future Study Should Focus On Increasing Temporal And Spatial Resolution Of The Method 2015, Indian Society Of Remote Sensing.

Article	Banihabib, Me//Azarnivand, A//Peralta, Rc	A New Framework For Strategic Planning To Stabilize A Shrinking Lake	Lake And Reservoir Management	Preventing Lake Urmia, The Sixth Largest Saltwater (Endorheic) Lake On The Earth, From Rapidly Drying Up Is A Paramount Mission Of The Iranian Government. Thus, A New Framework Was Proposed To Develop A Strategic Plan To Stabilize The Shrinking Lake, Based On Sustainable Development Criteria (Sdc). We Developed The Strategies Via The New Hybrid Strategic Sustainable Planning Framework (Sspf), Including A Strength-Weakness-Opportunity-Threat (Swot) Analysis Matrix, Sdc, Multi-Criteria Decision Making Models (Mcdms), And Sensitivity Analysis. First, To Develop Aggressive, Conservative, Competitive, And Defensive Strategies, Sspf Analyzed Site-Specific Internal Strengths And Weaknesses Plus External Opportunities And Threats. It Then, Preliminarily Ranked The Strategies By Embedding Sdc Within Mcdms (Analytic Hierarchy Process [Ahp], Simple Additive Weighting [Saw], And Technique For Order Of Preference By Similarity To Ideal Solution [Topsis]). To Promote Confidence In Selection Of The Strategy, Sensitivity Analyses Of The Results Were Also Performed. Here, The Selected Strategy Had The Highest Rank Among The Set Of Strategies, With The Least Sensitivity To The Input Data Variations. Saw And Ahp Were The Models Least And Most Sensitive To Sdc Weight Variations, Respectively. According To Sustainability Analysis, The Purely Structurally Oriented Strategies Were Determined To Be Environmentally Non-Sustainable. Based On The Results, We Identified 2 Conservative-Competitive Strategies That Could Stabilize The Lake And Prevent Future Losses. Adding Mcdms To The Combination Of Swot And Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix (Swot-Qspm) Enhanced The Process Of Decision Making. Hence, We Recommend Sspf As A Helpful Approach In Evaluating Sustainable And Strategic Solutions To This And Similar Problems. 2015 Copyright By The North American Lake Management Society.

The Main Objectives Of The Present Study Are To Evaluate Its Overall Water Quality And To Explore Its Hydrogeochemical Characteristics, Including The Potential Contamination From Heavy Metals And Metalloids Such As Co, Pb, Zn, Cd, Cu, Cr, Al And As. For This Purpose, 12 Water Samples Were Collected From The Main River Body And Its Tributaries Within Tabriz Plain. The Piper Diagram Classified Water Samples Mainly Into Nacl And Secondary Into Cahco 3 And Mixed Camgcl Types, Denoting A Profound Salinization Effect. The Cross-Plots Showed That Natural Geochemical Processes Including Dissolution Of Minerals (E.G., Carbonates, Evaporites And Silicates), As Well As Ion Exchange, Are The Predominant Factors That Contribute To Fluvial Hydrogeochemistry, While Anthropogenic Activities (Industrial And Agricultural) Impose Supplementary Effects. Cluster Analysis Classified Samples Into Two Distinct Clusters, Samples Of Cluster B Appear To Have Elevated Electrical Conductivity (Ec) Values And Trace Metals Concentrations Such As Co, Pb And Cd, While Sio 2 And Zn Are Low In Comparison With The Samples Of The Cluster A. The Main Processes Controlling Aji-Chay River Hydrogeochemistry And Water Quality Were Identified To Be Salinization And Rock Weathering. Both Are Related With Geogenic Sources Which Enrich River System With Elevated Values Of Na + , Cl , Ca 2+ , Mg 2+ , K + , So 4 2 And Ec As A Direct Effect Of Evaporites Leaching And Elevated Values Of Pb And Cd As An Impact From The Weathering Process Of Volcanic Formations.

Article	Dehghan, Z//Eslamian, Ss//Modarres, R	Spatial Clustering Of Maximum 24-H Rainfall Over Urmia Lake Basin By New Weighting Approaches	International Journal Of Climatology	The Lack Of Data In Rainfall Stations Of Iran Is One Of The Main Problems In Design And Management Of Hydrologic Systems. Moreover, The Density Of These Stations Network Is Not Sufficient For Estimation Of Rainfall At Ungauged Regions. Therefore, Regionalization Can Be An Essential Tool To Be Applied For Clustering The Rainfall And Spatial Pattern Analysis Of Homogeneous Regions To Quantify Regional Rainfall Patterns. Homogeneous Regions Are Usually Defined Based On Different Methods And With Consideration Of A Category Of Attributes. Selection Of Attributes As Representatives Of The Study Region Is An Important Aspect In Clustering Of A Region, As Is The Importance Degree (Or Determined Weight) That Each Of These Attributes Can Allocate To Themselves. Consequently, The Aim Of This Study Is To Select A Broad Category Of Climatic, Geographical, And Statistical Attributes Of The Maximum 24-H Rainfall Of The Urmia Lake Basin For 63 Selected Stations For The Period 19792008 And Next To Determine An Appropriate Weight For Each Of The Attributes In Each Defined Category. To Investigate The Weighting Effect In Regionalizing And To Determine The Appropriate Weight For Each Defined Attribute, Respectively, Ward'S Clustering Technique, Principal Component Analysis, And Correlation Coefficients Matrix Methods Were Used. The Homogeneity Measure Test Showed That All Identified Clusters Are Homogeneous. The Clustering Results Showed That Based On The Different Attributes Categories, Different Results Can Be Presented In Terms Of The Number Of Clusters, Distribution Of Stations, And Spatial Pattern Of Clusters. Moreover, The Performances Of The Proposed Weighting Approaches For Spatial Clustering Analysis Are Better Than No-Weight Scenario In Most Modes According To The Spatial Patterns And Homogeneity Measurements. 2017 Royal Meteorological Society	Attributes Weighting, Correlation Coefficients, Iran, Principal Component Analysis, Urmia Lake Basin, Ward'S Clustering, Clustering Algorithms, Information Management, Lakes, Rain, Spatial Variables Measurement, Attributes Weighting, Correlation Coefficient, Iran, Lake Basins, Ward'S Clustering, Principal Component Analysis, Cluster Analysis, Correlation, Estimation Method, Homogeneity, Principal Component Analysis, Rainfall, Regional Climate, Spatial Analysis, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1002/JOC.5335	2298-2313	Scopus	38	2018
Article	Dehghani, Mh//Asghari, Fb//Yousefi, M	The Effect Of Salt Basins On The Trend Of Groundwater Quality Changes In The Surrounding Basins (Case Study: Tabriz Plain, Northwest Of Iran)	Desalination And Water Treatment	Urmia Lake Is One Of The Most Important Inland Water Bodies In Iran And Tabriz Plain Which Is Located In The Northwest Of Iran. In The Last Decade, The Average Water Level Of This Lake Has Been Reduced, And Since The Urmia Lake And Surrounding Groundwater Of This Lake Are Related To Each Other, Surveying The Changes In The Quality And Quantity Of These Water Resources Is Important. The Qualitative Parameters (Ph, Sodium Adsorption Ratio (Sar), Electrical Conductivity, Na + , Total Dissolved Solids, Ca 2+ , K + , Mg 2+ , Cl , Co 3 2 , Hco 3 , %Na, And So 4 2 ) From About 130 Wells Of Tabriz Plain Groundwater Were Investigated From 2010 To 2015. Data Were Analyzed Using Geographic Information Systems. Modified Mannkendall Test And The Values Of Trend Slope Using The Theilsen Estimator Were Estimated, And For These Tests, The R Software Was Used. Based On The Results, Water Samples Have An Alkaline Face And Were Ca 2+ Mg 2+ Na + And Cl Hco 3 So 4 2 Types And Characterized As Very Hard And Brackish Water Throughout The Study Period. Based On The Results Of Water Analysis, Most Of The Qualitative Parameters Were Over The World Health Organization Standard Limit. The Water Of Urmia Lake Has Decreased And The Amount Of Salinity Increased, So Changes Trending In Sar, Na + , %Na + , And Cl In The Tabriz Plain Groundwater Indicate That Changes In The Quality Of Urmia Lake Have A Significant Impact On The Quality Of Tabriz Plain Groundwater. 2019 Desalination Publications.

A Total Of 210 Individual Specimens Were Collected From The Surface And Bottom Layers From Three Different Geographical Areas, Comprising Six Sampling Sites In Urmia Lake (Iran). The Mitochondrial Rdna Gene Region Was Amplified Using The Pcr Technique Followed By Rflp Analysis Based On Using Eleven Restriction Endonucleases. Analysis At The Intrapopulation Level Indicated That The Two Median And South Area Bottom Layers Have Somewhat Higher Proportion Of Polymorphic Sites Compare To Others. Although Floating And Sinking Cysts Did Not Consistently Show Genetic Differences, There Was Significant Genetic Variation Among All Samples (Fst=0.019, P=0.03) And 98% Of The Variation Was Within Samples. Our Results Clearly Distinguished Nucleotide Divergence And Genetic Structuring Patterns, Suggest That May Be Genetic Differentiation Existed In Artemia Populations From Urmia Lake. Pairwise Comparisons Of The Samples Showed That The South Area Surface Layer Location Was The Most Genetically Divergent Of The Six Sampling Sites.

Article	Eisavi, V//Homayouni, S//Rezaei, Chiyaneh, E	Apple Orchard Phenology Response To Desiccation And Temperature Changes In Urmia Lake Region	International Journal Of Environmental Science And Technology	Agricultural Production Activities, Such As Those For Various Fruits And Cereals, Play A Significant Role In The Local Economy And Food Security Of The Urmia Lake Region. In Particular, This Region Has Thousands Of Hectares Of Apple Orchards, Which Have An Important Socioeconomic Impact On The Life Of People. Climate And Land Cover Changes Over The Past Several Decades Threaten The Apple Orchards Phenology (Aop). Recent Studies Have Emphasized The Effect Of Temperature On Plant Phenology, However, They Have Overlooked The Influence Of Land Cover Changes, Such As Lake Desiccation, On Plant Phenology. Meanwhile, How Climate Change And Lake Desiccation Will Affect The Aop Is Still Not Very Well Understood. Therefore, In This Study, We Used The Enhanced Vegetation Index (Evi) Extracted From Remote Sensing Images Acquired By The Modis Sensor Spanning From 2003 To 2014, In Order To Extract The Aop Events. Furthermore, We Used A Random Forest Regression (Rfr) For Analyzing The Relationship Between Temperature Changes/Lake Desiccation And Aop. The Results Revealed That Evi Is A Very Useful Tool For Estimating The Aop With A Mean Root-Mean-Square Error Of 6.25Days. Moreover, There Is A Linear Trend Toward The Early Start Of Season In This Region. The End Of Season (Eos) And The Growing Season Length Have Also Increased In The Areas Closer To The Lake Until 2008. This Seems That The Delayed Eos In The Area Closest To Urmia Lake Has Been Associated With The Lake Microclimate Since 2008. 2017, Islamic Azad University (Iau).

The Present Study Was Conducted To Simulate Soil Salinity In The Root And Transition Zones In Ten Years Of Simulation Period And Assume The Impact Of Drain Depth And Irrigation Scenarios On Soil Salinity And Depth To Water Table. Thus, Saltmod Was Used With The Geo-Hydrological Data Collected From Dizaj-E Dowl Area Located In The Northwest Of The Urmia Lake. The Results Indicated That The Leaching Efficiency Of 0.5 In The Root Zone And Natural Drain Depth Of 8.5 And 5.5 M/Season Were The Best Match With The Observed Data. Soil Salinity In The Root Zone Had A Consistent Trend Both Above And Below The Drain Level Rise From 8 Ds/M During The First Season To 55 Ds/M In The Second Season. Based On The Water Table, An Increase Of 7.7 M Occurred After 10 Years Of The Simulation Period. In Addition, The Drain Depth Of 1.2 M Assumed In The Pilot Area Appeared To Be Feasible.

This Study Presented The Monthly And Spatial Variations Of Atmospheric Df And Their Elemental Components (Al, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, Se, Sr, Ti, V, Si, And Hg). Dust Samples Were Collected From Four Urban And Suburban Sampling Sites Around Tabriz, Iran, By Using The Astm Method D-1739 During April To September 2017. Moreover, The Icp-Oes Was Used To Determine Metal Components Of The Df. The Obtained Results Showed That The Df Amount Ranged Between 1.8-27.6 (7.4 5.6) G/M2.Month. The Elements Of Fe (11863-13,906 Mg/Kg And 85%-89%), Al (858-1205 Mg/Kg And 4%-8%), And Si (274-386 Mg/Kg) Were The Dominant Elemental Concentrations Of The Df. The Average Value Of Enrichment Factor (Ef) For Hg, Pb, Cu, Sr, Co, Ni, Mn, And V Was Greater Than 10 In All The Samples, Showing That Anthropogenic Sources Emit A Considerable Amount Of Elements In Df Rather Than The Soil Or Urmia Lake Bed. The Result Of Correlations Between The Concentration Of Dust Fall With Humidity, Temperature, Wind Speed, And Precipitation Showed That There Was A Direct Relationship Between The Amount Of Dust Fall And Wind Speed While Humidity, Precipitation, And Temperature Were Inversely Proportional To The Amount Of Dust Fall. This Study Revealed That Earth Crust And Anthropogenic Activities Such As Vehicle Traffic, Combustion Of Fossil Fuel, And Different Industrial Activities Were The Main Sources Of The Df In The Studied Areas. 2019 Springer Nature Switzerland Ag.

Two Main Conversion Technologies Of Sge Are Membrane-Based Processes, Pressure Retarded Osmosis (Pro) And Reverse Electrodialysis (Red). In Pro, Semipermeable Membranes Placed Between The Two Streams Of Solutions Allow The Transport Of Water From Lowpressure Diluted Solution To High-Pressure Concentrated Solution. Red Requires Two Alternating Semipermeable Membranes That Allow The Diffusion Of The Ions But Not The Flow Of H2O. Lifetime And Power Density Of The Semipermeable Membrane Are Two Main Factors Affecting On Deployment Of Pro And Red. Semipermeable Membranes With Lifetime Greater Than 10 Years And Power Density Higher Than 5 W/M2 Would Lead To Faster Development Of This Conversion Technology. An Exergy Analysis Of An Sge System Of Sea-River Can Be Applied To Calculate The Maximum Potential Power For Electricity Generation. Seawater Is Taken As Reference Environment (Global Dead State) For Calculating The Exergy Of Water Since The Seawater Is The Final Reservoir. Once The Fresh Water Is Mixed With Water Of The Sea Or Lake It Becomes Unuseful For Human, Agricultural Or Industrial Uses Loses All Its Exergy.

The Importance Of The Prediction Of Water Level Balance In Lake Urmia Is Necessary Due To Several-Meter Fluctuations In The Last Decade Which Help The Prevention From Possible Future Losses. For This Purpose, In This Paper, The Performance Of Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (Anfis) For Predicting The Lake Water Level Balance Has Been Studied. In Addition, For The Training Of The Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System, Particle Swarm Optimization (Pso) And Hybrid Backpropagation-Recursive Least Square Method Algorithm Have Been Used. Moreover, A Hybrid Method Based On Particle Swarm Optimization And Recursive Least Square (Pso-Rls) Training Algorithm For The Training Of Anfis Structure Is Introduced. In Order To Have A More Fare Comparison, Hybrid Particle Swarm Optimization And Gradient Descent Are Also Applied. The Models Have Been Trained, Tested, And Validated Based On Lake Level Data Between 1991 And 2014. For Performance Evaluation, A Comparison Is Made Between These Methods. Numerical Results Obtained Show That The Proposed Methods With A Reasonable Error Have A Good Performance In Water Level Balance Prediction. It Is Also Clear That With Continuing The Current Trend, Lake Urmia Will Experience More Drop In The Water Level Balance In The Upcoming Years. 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

Article	Farajzadeh, J//Fakheri, Fard, A//Lotfi, S	Modeling Of Monthly Rainfall And Runoff Of Urmia Lake Basin Using Feed-Forward Neural Network And Time Series Analysis Model	Water Resources And Industry	Urmia Lake Basin Located In Northwestern Iran Is The Second Largest Saline Lake In The World. Due To Many Reasons I.E. Climate Changes, Several Dam Constructions, Building A Bridge Across The Lake, Extra Agricultural Consumption And Improper Management Of Water Resources, The Water Level Of The Lake Has Been Decreased Since 1997 And Thousand Hectares Of Emerged Salty Land Has Made Numerous Ecological And Environmental Problems. Therefore, An Accurate Forecast Of The Entrance Runoff To The Lake Is Important In Managing The River Flow And Water Transfer Within Basins. There Are Various Methods For Time-Series Based Forecasting, In The Presented Study Feed-Forward Neural Network And Autocorrelation Regressive Integrated Moving Average (Arima) Models Were Applied To Forecast The Monthly Rainfall In Urmia Lake Basin. The Results Showed That The Estimated Values Of Monthly Rainfall Through Feed-Forward Nn Were Close To Arima Model With Coefficient Of Correlation 0.62 And The Root Mean Square Error Of 12.43. Mm Over The 6 Years Test Period, Then Rainfall Amount Were Predicted For A 6-Year Period Starting From 2012 (2012-2017). Using The Runoff Coefficient Regime Which Was Calculated From Parallel Data Of Rainfall Over The Basin And Resulted Runoff For The Period Of 39 Years, The Future Runoff Were Obtained Through Predicted Rainfall Over That Period. 2014 The Authors.

Article	Farazmand, A//Inanloo, K//Agh, N	Expression Of Dmrt Family Genes During Gonadal Differentiation In Two Species Of Artemia (Branchiopoda, Anostraca) From Urmia Lake (Iran)	Crustaceana	The Dmrt (Doublesex- And Mab-3-Related Transcription Factor) Family Of Genes, Originally Implicated In The Sex Differentiation Of Drosophila And Caenorhabditis Elegans, Is Now Known To Be Involved In Early Differentiation Of Sex Among Species In A Variety Of Phyla. The Conserved Motif Shared By These Two Genes In All Organisms Is Referred To As The Dm Domain. In The Present Study The Expression Patterns Of Dmrt-Related Genes In The Differentiating Gonads Of Two Species Of Aquatic Crustaceans, Artemia Urmiana And Artemia Parthenogenetica, Which Differ In The Paths Adopted For Reproduction, Were Compared. Studies Using The Rt-Pcr Procedure On The Gonads Of Nauplius Larvae Of These Species At Different Stages Of Early Development Indicated That Dmrt Genes Are Expressed Only In Female Gonads, Regardless Of The Mode Of Reproduction Prevalent In The Specific Species Of Artemia. In Situ Hybridization In Whole Mounts Of Gonads At Different Stages Of Development Confirmed Our Rt-Pcr Results, Suggesting That, Unlike The Situation In Mammals, Dmrt Genes Are Involved In The Early Ovarian, But Not In Testicular, Differentiation.

We Investigated Water Level Data (Annual Maximum, Minimum And Average Series In The Period Of 1966-2012) To Evaluate Changes Based On Long-Term And Seasonal Patterns Over Time, Data Characteristics And Temporal Change Analysis. Our Tools For The Mentioned Analyses Included Seasonal Trend Decomposition Using Loess (Stl), Normality And Independence, Change Point And Trend Analysis. The Results Of Stl Revealed A Sustained Decline Occurring After The Last 1990S And Loess Trend Line Confirmed It. The Analyses Of Data Characteristics Showed That The Observed Data Do Not Fulfil The Assumptions Of Being Independent And Identically Normal-Distributed. Therefore, The Non-Parametric Pettitt'S Test Was Applied To Identify An Abrupt Change Point In The Data Series, Followed By Trend Analysis Using The Non-Parametric Mann-Kendall Test. Results Showed That There Is A Significant Decreasing Trend In Water Lake Level And The Beginning Of Change Point Is In 1996. Copyright 2014 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

Article	Fathian, F//Morid, S//Kahya, E	Identification Of Trends In Hydrological And Climatic Variables In Urmia Lake Basin, Iran	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	The Drawdown Trend Of The Water Level In Urmia Lake Poses A Serious Problem For Northwestern Iran Which Has Had Negative Impacts On Agriculture And Industry. This Research Investigated Likely Causes Of The Predicament By Estimating Trends In The Time Series Of Hydroclimatic Variables Of The Basin. Three Non-Parametric Statistical Tests, The Mannkendall, Spearman Rho, And Sens T, Were Applied To Estimate The Trends In The Annual And Seasonal Time Series Of Temperature, Precipitation, And Streamflow At 95 Stations Throughout The Basin. The Theilsen Method Was Also Used To Estimate The Slopes Of Trend Lines Of Annual Time Series. The Results Showed A Significant Increasing Trend Of Temperature Throughout The Basin And An Area-Specific Precipitation Trend. The Tests Also Confirmed A General Decreasing Trend In The Basin Streamflow That Was More Pronounced In The Downstream Stations. The Annual Trend Line Slope Was Found To Be From 0.02 To 0.14C/Year, 7.5 To 3.8Mm/Year, And 0.01 To 0.4M3/S/Year For Temperature, Precipitation, And Streamflow, Respectively. The Homogeneity Of The Monthly Trends Was Also Evaluated Using The Van Belle And Hughes Tests As Confirmation. Temporal Analyses Of The Trends For The Temperature And Streamflow Of The Basin Detected Significant Increasing Trends Beginning In The Mid-1980S And 1990S. The Correlations Between Streamflow And Climate Variables (Temperature And Precipitation) Were Detected By Pearsons Test. The Results Showed That The Streamflow In Urmia Lake Basin Is More Sensitive To Changes In Temperature Than Precipitation. In General, The Decline In The Lake Water Level Can Be Related To Both The Increase Of Temperature In The Basin And An Improvement In Over-Exploitation Of The Water Resources. 2014, Springer-Verlag Wien.

The Variations Are Estimated Using 11Years Of Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiments (Grace) Observations From Period Of 2003 To April 2014 In Combination With The Outputs Of Global Land Data Assimilation Systems (Gldas) Model Including Soil Moisture, Snow Water Equivalent, And Total Canopy Water Storage. To Do So, The Sums Of Gldas Outputs Are Subtracted From Terrestrial Water Storage Variations Determined By Grace Observations. Because Of Stripping Errors In The Grace Data, Two Methodologies Based On Wavelet Analysis And Gaussian Filtering Are Applied To Refine The Grace Data. It Is Shown That The Wavelet Approach Could Better Localize The Desired Signal And Increase The Signal-To-Noise Ratio And Thus Results In More Accurate Estimation Of Groundwater Storage Variations. To Validate The Results Of Our Procedure In Estimation Of Ground Water Storage Variations, They Are Compared With The Measurements Of Pisometric Wells Data Near The Urmia Lake Which Shows Favorable Agreements With Our Results. 2016, National Groundwater Association.

Article	Fazel, N//Torabi, Haghighi, A//Klve, B	Analysis Of Land Use And Climate Change Impacts By Comparing River Flow Records For Headwaters And Lowland Reaches	Global And Planetary Change	The Natural Flow Regime Of Rivers Has Been Strongly Altered World-Wide, Resulting In Ecosystem Degradation And Lakes Drying Up, Especially In Arid And Semi-Arid Regions. Determining Whether This Is Due Mainly To Climate Change Or To Water Withdrawal For Direct Human Use (E.G. Irrigation) Is Difficult, Particularly For Saline Lake Basins Where Hydrology Data Are Scarce. In This Study, We Developed An Approach For Assessing Climate And Land Use Change Impacts Based On River Flow Records For Headwater And Lowland Reaches Of Rivers, Using The Case Of Lake Urmia Basin, In North-Westen Iran. Flow Regimes At Upstream And Downstream Stations Were Studied Before And After Major Dam Construction And Irrigation Projects. Data From 57 Stations Were Used To Establish Five Different Time Intervals Representing 10 Different Land Use Development Periods (Scenarios) For Upstream (Not Impacted) And Downstream (Impacted) Systems. An Existing River Impact (Ri) Index Was Used To Assess Changes In Three Main Characteristics Of Flow (Magnitude, Timing And, Intra-Annual Variability). The Results Showed That Irrigation Was By Far The Main Driving Force For River Flow Regime Changes In The Lake Basin. All Stations Close To The Lake And On Adjacent Plains Showed Significantly Higher Impacts Of Land Use Change Than Headwaters. As Headwaters Are Relatively Unaffected By Agriculture, The Non-Significant Changes Observed In Headwater Flow Regimes Indicate A Minor Effect Of Climate Change On River Flows In The Region. The Benefit Of The Method Developed Is Clear Interpretation Of Results Based On River Flow Records, Which Is Useful In Communicating Land Use And Climate Change Information To Decision Makers And Lake Restoration Planners. 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Nine Landslide Causal Factors Were Used, Whereby The Respective Parameters Were Extracted From An Associated Spatial Database. These Factors Were Evaluated, And Then The Respective Factor Weight And Class Weight Were Assigned To Each Of The Associated Factors Using Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp). A Landslide Susceptibility Map Was Produced Based On Owa Multicriteria Decision Analysis. In Order To Validate The Result, The Outcome Of The Owa Method Was Qualitatively Evaluated Based On An Existing Inventory Of Known Landslides. Correspondingly, An Uncertainty Analysis Was Carried Out Using The Dempster-Shafer Theory. Based On The Results, Very Strong Support Was Determined For The High Susceptibility Category Of The Landslide Susceptibility Map, While Strong Support Was Received For The Areas With Moderate Susceptibility. In This Paper, We Discuss In Which Respect These Results Are Useful For An Improved Understanding Of The Effectiveness Of Owa In Lsm, And How The Landslide Prediction Map Can Be Used For Spatial Planning Tasks And For The Mitigation Of Future Hazards In The Study Area. 2012 Taylor & Francis.

This Peninsula Is A Complex Stratovolcano With A Collapsed Center, Which Is Elevated Due To Later Intrusions Of Sub-Volcanic Masses With Trachytic To Microsyenitic Composition. The Compo- Site Cone Consists Of A Sequence Of Leucite Tephrite, Tephrite, Leucite Basanite, Basanite And Related Pyroclastic Rocks. Magmatic Activities In The Eslamy Peninsula Begin With Potassic Alkaline To Ultra- Potassic And Basic, Silica-Undersaturated Shoshonitic Rocks And They Are Followed By Intrusions Of Lamprophyric Dykes And End With Acidic Magmatism Including Trachytic, Microsyenitic, Syenitic And Phonolitic Domes. The Original Magma Of The Eslamy Peninsula Rocks Has A Potassic Alkaline Nature (Roman Type) Rich In Lree And Lile And Depleted Of Hree. These Characteristics Suggest That The Origin Of Magma Can Be From Deep Mantle With A Garnet Lherzolite Composition, A Low Partial Melting Rate Which Has Been Contaminated By Crustal Materials In Its Way Up. Fractional Crystallization Of Olivine, Diopsidic Clinopyroxene And Leucite Played An Important Role In The Evolution Of Magmas.

Article	Hamzehpour, N//Shafizadeh, Moghadam, H//Valavi, R	Exploring The Driving Forces And Digital Mapping Of Soil Organic Carbon Using Remote Sensing And Soil Texture	Catena	The Main Objectives Of This Paper Were 1) To Estimate Soil Organic Carbon (Soc) Using Remote Sensing Covariates, Soil Properties, And Topographic Factors, And 2) To Evaluate The Interaction And The Relative Influence Of The Selected Factors On The Spatial Variation Of Soc. Thirteen Factors Were Considered For Digital Mapping Of Soc In The West Urmia Lake In Iran. To Quantify Multicollinearity Among The Predictor Variables, Variance Inflation Factor (Vif) Was Calculated. Among Them, Nine Independent Factors Were Remained Including Silt, Sand, Slope, Enhanced Vegetation Index (Evi), Brightness, Wetness, Land Cover, And Latitude And Longitude. A Machine Learning Algorithm Called Gradient Boosting Machine (Gbm) Was Calibrated For Understanding The Spatial Dynamic And Prediction Of Soc. Model Performance Showed That Gbm Explained 43.5% (R2) Of The Soc Variation, And Root Mean Square Error (Rmse) Was 0.23%. Results Showed That Evi And Sand Were The Most Influential Factors Of The Soc Variation While Slope And Land Cover Were The Least Important Ones. Furthermore, Significant Interaction Among Evi-Wetness-Soc And Evi-Sand-Soc Was Detected. On The Other Hand, 45.2% Of Soc Variation Was Estimated By Remote Sensing Covariates. These Results Suggested That Gbm Was A Promising Approach For An In-Depth Understanding Of The Soc Variation Over Space. 2019 Elsevier B.V.

The Aim Of This Study Is To Propose A Reclamation Strategy For The Lake By Focusing On Estimation Of Environmental Requirement Thresholds Under Various Drought Severity Conditions. On The Average, The Lake Will Remain In A Moderate Hydrological Drought Condition If The Business-As-Usual Scenario Prevails. The Shares Of Natural Drought, Water Withdrawals And Water Resources Development Projects (I.E. Dams) In Recent Lake Inflow Reduction Are Estimated At 45%, 40% And 15%, Respectively, Thus, The Aggregated Contribution Of Human-Induced Factors Has A More Significant Impact On The Current Lake Condition Than That Of Natural Drought, And A Firm And Consistent Approach To Reduce Water Consumption By The Agricultural Sector Is Required For Lake Reclamation. 2015 Taylor & Francis.

Article	Hassanzadeh, E//Zarghami, M//Hassanzadeh, Y	Determining The Main Factors In Declining The Urmia Lake Level By Using System Dynamics Modeling	Water Resources Management	Urmia Lake In Iran Is The Second Largest Saline Lake In The World. This Ecosystem Is The Home For Different Species. Due To Various Socio-Economical And Ecological Criteria, Urmia Lake Has Important Role In The Northwestern Part Of The Country But It Has Faced Many Problems In Recent Years. Because Of Droughts, Overuse Of Surface Water Resources And Dam Constructions, Water Level Has Decreased In Such A Way That One Quarter Of The Lake Has Changed To Saline Area In The Last 10 Years. The Purpose Of This Research Is To Determine The Main Factors Which Reduce The Lake'S Water Level. To This End, A Simulation Model, Based On System Dynamics Method, Is Developed For The Urmia Lake Basin To Estimate The Lake'S Level. After Successful Verification Of The Model, Results Show That (Among The Proposed Factors) Changes In Inflows Due To The Climate Change And Overuse Of Surface Water Resources Is The Main Factor For 65% Of The Effect, Constructing Four Dams Is Responsible For 25% Of The Problem, And Less Precipitation On Lake Has 10% Effect On Decreasing The Lake'S Level In The Recent Years. In The Future, The Model Also Can Be Used By Managers As A Decision Support System To Find The Effects Of Building New Dams Or Other Infrastructures. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

Article	Heidari, N//Roudgar, M//Ebrahimpour, N	Bbthermodynamic Quantities And Urmia Sea Water Evaporation	Saline Systems	The Relation Between Climatic Parameters (Relative Air Humidity) And The Water Activity Of The Urmia Sea Water Determines The Possible Maximum Evaporation Of The Lake. Using The Pitzer Thermodynamic Approach, The Activity Of The Urmia Lake Water During Evaporation Was Calculated And Compared To The Present Relative Air Humidity Above The Water. Present Climatic Conditions Allow The Urmia Sea Water To Evaporate Down To Water With Activity Of 0.55, Corresponding To The Lowest Air Humidity Measured Over The Lake. This Water Activity Falls In The Range Of Halite Precipitation, While Carnalite Precipitation Starts At Somewhat Lower (A H2O=0.499) Point. Our Dynamic Model Predicts That For Air Humidity As Low As 55% (Reflecting Present Climate Conditions), The Urmia Sea Level May Drop To As Low As 1270 M (I. E., 1270 M Above Mean Sea Level). At That Point, The Lake Water Volume Will Have A Volume Of 11 Km3. For The Sake Of Comparison, At The Beginning Of 1990, The Level Of The Lake Was 1275 M, Its Volume Was 25 Km3, And Its Surface Area Was 5145 Km2 2010 Heidari Et Al, Licensee Biomed Central Ltd.

Disenfranchised Groups Often Lose Access To Water Resources Because Their Interests Are Not Well Represented By Decision Makers. Excluding These Groups From Resource Management Policy Often Results In Myopic Decisions That Contribute To Further Ecosystem Damage. We Describe The Ecological Degradation Of Lake Urmia In Iran, Which Has Recently Experienced Increased Salinity And Declining Water Quantity. The Lake Is A Unesco Biosphere Reserve And Ramsar Site, And Supports Unique Biodiversity In The Region. The Lake'S Decline Is Driven By The Destruction Of Zagros Forests And The Government'S Water Policies, Which Diverted Water To More Politically Connected Agricultural Land Users, Increasing Social Inequity And Prompting More Deforestation. The Most Straightforward Restoration Solution Is To Discontinue The Diversions And Allow Critical Inflows To Recharge Lake Urmia, Preserving The Lake And Wetlands For Migratory Birds, Tourists, And Local Communities. 2014 Taylor & Francis Group, Llc.

Article	Jalili, S//Hamidi, Sa//Namdar, Ghanbari, R	Climate Variability And Anthropogenic Effects On Lake Urmia Water Level Fluctuations, Northwestern Iran	Hydrological Sciences Journal	Lake Urmia, The Second Largest Hyper-Saline Lake On Earth, Has Recently Experienced A Dramatic Water-Level Reduction. This Could Have Been Caused By Climate Change Or Other Anthropogenic Effects, However It Could Also Be A Part Of Natural Climate Variability. To Explore The Hydroclimate Variability Effect On The Lake Water Level, Two Teleconnections Were Considered For Analysis: The Southern Oscillation Index (Soi) And The North Atlantic Oscillation (Nao). Spectral And Coherency Analyses Were Used To Recognize The Frequency Components And The Relationship Between The Teleconnections And The Lake Water-Level Fluctuations. The Results Show That The Recent Water Level Fall And The Rise Of Water Level In 19941999 Cannot Be Explained By The Natural Periodic Behavior Of Lake Urmia. The Inter-Decadal Water-Level Oscillations Are Coherent With Nao And Soi Components Of Such Oscillations. The Anthropogenic Effect On The Lake Water Level Was Also Explored Using Non-Parametric Trend Analysis. The Results Show That The Lake Water Level Has A Positive Trend Between 1966 And 1995, But The Trend Is Not Significant At A 95% Confidence Level. However, The Trend Between 1995 And 2009 Is Negative And It Is Significant At A 99% Confidence Interval. This Study Shows That The Very Recent Fall In Water Level Is Due To Anthropogenic Impacts Rather Than Natural Variability. Editor Z.W. Kundzewicz, Associate Editor Not Assigned 2016 Iahs.

Article	Montaseri, M//Amirataee, B//Rezaie, H	New Approach In Bivariate Drought Duration And Severity Analysis	Journal Of Hydrology	The Copula Functions Have Been Widely Applied As An Advance Technique To Create Joint Probability Distribution Of Drought Duration And Severity. The Approach Of Data Collection As Well As The Amount Of Data And Dispersion Of Data Series Can Last A Significant Impact On Creating Such Joint Probability Distribution Using Copulas. Usually, Such Traditional Analyses Have Shed An Unconnected Drought Runs (Udr) Approach Towards Droughts. In Other Word, Droughts With Different Durations Would Be Independent Of Each Other. Emphasis On Such Data Collection Method Causes The Omission Of Actual Potentials Of Short-Term Extreme Droughts Located Within A Long-Term Udr. Meanwhile, Traditional Method Is Often Faced With Significant Gap In Drought Data Series. However, A Long-Term Udr Can Be Approached As A Combination Of Short-Term Connected Drought Runs (Cdr). Therefore This Study Aims To Evaluate Systematically Two Udr And Cdr Procedures In Joint Probability Of Drought Duration And Severity Investigations. For This Purpose, Rainfall Data (19712013) From 24 Rain Gauges In Lake Urmia Basin, Iran Were Applied. Also, Seven Common Univariate Marginal Distributions And Seven Types Of Bivariate Copulas Were Examined. Compared To Traditional Approach, The Results Demonstrated A Significant Comparative Advantage Of The New Approach. Such Comparative Advantages Led To Determine The Correct Copula Function, More Accurate Estimation Of Copula Parameter, More Realistic Estimation Of Joint/Conditional Probabilities Of Drought Duration And Severity And Significant Reduction In Uncertainty For Modeling. 2018 Elsevier B.V.

However, This Process May Depend On Plant Spices, Plant Developmental Stages And Habitat Conditions. Vegetation Cover In Arid And Semi-Arid Regions Is Mostly In The Form Of Plant Patches And Bare Soil Of Inter-Patch Areas And This Form Of Vegetation Cover Can Be Useful To Study Plants Impact On Soil To Get Applicable Knowledge For Predicting Plants Efficiency In Restoration Projects. This Study Was Conducted In 2016 To Study Some Soil Properties In Vegetation Patches Of Some Halophytes From Urmia Lake, Iran. The Results Showed That Soil Ec Decreased From10.32 (Ms.Cm-1) In Bare Soil To 4.92 (Ms.Cm-1) In Vegetated Areas. Also, Significant Increase Of Soil Ph And Phosphorous Content Was Observed In Vegetation Patches That Were 8.73 And 29.61 (Ppm) Respectively In Comparison With Bare Soil With 8.51 And 12.81 (Ppm) Patches. As Vegetation Patches Caused A Decrease In Soil Evaluated Cations, The Main Shoot Succulent Halophytes Of Salsola Dendroides, S. Nitraria, S. Iberica And Halocnemum Strobilaceum Which Can Uptake These Ions Were Selected To Measure Their Above Ground Biomass And Root Tissues Content Of These Salts, The Results Showed A Significant Difference Between Plant Species In Their Salt Uptake And Accumulating Ability. Halocnemum Strobilaceum Had Higher Amount Of Sodium And Magnesium In Shoots That Were 9.73 And 2.96 (Mg.Kg-1), Respectively. So, It Had The Most Ability To Absorb These Salts By Roots Transporting Them To Shoots.

This Study Presents Reproduction Characteristics, Survival Rate And Sex-Ratio Of Four Artemia Salina Populations From Tunisia Cultured Under Standard Conditions. Results Show That Both Low (17.8% And 30.6% In Megrine Saltwork And Sabkhet Sijoumi, Respectively) And High (83.9% For Sahline Saltwork) Values Were Recorded For The Percentage Of Total Oviparous Offspring. The Offspring Per Brood Varied From 70.341.9 (Megrine Saltwork) To 73.651.4 (Sabkhet El Adhibet). Broods Per Female Varied Between 3.10.9 (Sahline Saltwork) And 4.51.2 (Megrine Saltwork), And Time Between Broods Ranged From 5.71.1 To 6.52.2 Days For Megrine And Sahline, Respectively. Statistical Analysis (One-Way Analysis Of Variance, Tukey'S Hsd Test, P50.05) Revealed No Significant Differences Between Reproductive Traits Of The Four Studied Populations Except For Mean Of Oviparous And Oviviparous Offspring Per Female (F=9.158, P50.05), And Brood Per Female (F=4.779, P50.05). The Survival Rate Of The Four Studied A. Salina Populations Fluctuated Between 31.4% And 64.5% For Megrine And Sahline Saltwork, Respectively. However, The Sex-Ratio Showed That For Megrine Saltwork And Sabkhet El Adhibet, Males Predominated With 1 : 0.90 And 1 : 0.97 (Males : Females), Respectively. The Comparison Between Our Results And Those Reported Of Other Artemia Populations Showed That The Offspring Per Brood Of Tunisian Artemia Are Comparable To A. Persimilis But Different To A. Salina From Abu Kammash (Libya) And A. Urmiana (Urmia Lake, Iran), And That Days Between Brood, Are Similar To A. Salina From Abu Kammash, A. Sinica And Polyploid A.

Article	Nazeri, Tahroudi, M//Khashei, Siuki, A//Ramezani, Y	Redesigning And Monitoring Groundwater Quality And Quantity Networks By Using The Entropy Theory	Environmental Monitoring And Assessment	This Study Aimed At Redesigning And Monitoring The Groundwater Network Of Naqadeh Plain In The Southwest Of Lake Urmia To Examine The Number And Position Of Optimal Wells For The Salinity Information Transfer (Ec) And Survey Of Groundwater Level At Aquifer. In This Regard, Groundwater Level Data (35 Wells) And Electrical Conductivity Values (24 Wells) Were Used During A 10-Year Period (20022012). In The First Stage, Simulation Was Conducted Using The Multivariate Regression Method And Quantitative And Qualitative Values And The Interaction Of Wells Was Observed. In The Next Stage, Number Of Different Classes Was Considered For Clustering Quantitative And Quantitative Values. The Results Of Studying Different Classes Of Data Clustering Showed That The 12-Class Cluster Had More Accurate Results Based On The Root Mean Square Error And Coefficient Of Determination. The Root Mean Square Error Was Improved By About 40, 21, And 15%, Respectively, Compared To The 3, 5, And 9-Classe Clusters. Finally, By Choosing Proper Cluster Of Data, Entropy Indicators Were Investigated For Quantitative And Qualitative Values At The Aquifer Level. The Results Of Entropy Indices At The Aquifer Showed That There Was A Severe Shortage Of Information In Terms Of Salinity In The Northwest Of The Aquifer, Which Necessitates Drilling A New Well In This Area To Accurately Monitor The Ec Values. However, Since More Than 90% Of The Basin Area Is In Surplus And Approximately Surplus Conditions In Terms Of Transferring Information, The Studied Area Has A Good Dispersion For Qualitative Monitoring. Information Transfer Index For The Quantitative Groundwater Network Monitoring Showed That Piezometers Near Lake Urmia Were Faced With A Lack Of Information, Which According To Piezometers Ranking, Is Ranked Last In Terms Of Value Of Maintaining Or Keeping The Network. Eastern Areas Of Aquifer Are Also Faced With Shortage Of Piezometers Accounting For About 3% Of The Total Area. The Results Of Survey Of Surplus Wells In The Aquifer Showed That Nine And Six Surplus Wells Are In The Aquifer For The Qualitative And Quantitative Network, Respectively. There Were Also Wells In Which Information Transfer Was Not Well Done And Their Information Could Not Be Assured. Finally, Based On The Conditions, A New Arrangement Of Wells And A New Optimal Network Were Proposed. 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland Ag.

Article	Nazeri, Tahroudi, M//Pourreza, Bilondi, M//Ramezani, Y	Toward Coupling Hydrological And Meteorological Drought Characteristics In Lake Urmia Basin, Iran	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	Investigation Of Precipitation Characteristics On Daily, Monthly, And Annual Time Scales Can Contribute To Gaining Important Information Related To Temporal And Spatial Distribution Of Precipitation Or Even Flow Rate Challenges (E.G., Hydrological Droughts). The Low Levels Of Long-Term Precipitation And High Variability In Different Time Scales Are Considered The Main Inherent Characteristics Of Climate In Iran. Due To The Direct Effects Of Precipitation On Water Resources, Especially On The River Flow Rate, It Is Necessary To Assess The Efficient Indices To Visualize The Variations In The Components Of Water Resources. One Of The Main Indices Is The Precipitation Concentration Index (Pci) Which Is Known As A Strong Indicator Of The Precipitation Distribution Generally Used On Annual And Seasonal Scales. In This Study, Drought Analysis In The Lake Urmia Basin (Lub) Located In Northwest Of Iran Was Performed With The Daily River Flow Rate And Monthly Precipitation Values Within The Period Of 19842013. The Results Of Changes In Precipitation Indicated That The Irregularity Of Precipitation Distribution Had Grown In Spring Months. Also, Due To The Diminishing Precipitation Trend On The Annual Time Scale, Pci Index Also Increased. It Is Concluded That Lub Detected A Significant Descending Trend On The Annual, Spring, And Winter Time Scales In The Last 30 Years. The Pci Values Were Proved High Irregularity In Summer With Pci Amount Of 20.1 And Most Regularity In Winter With Pci Amount Of 10.4. This Paper Also Aims To Assess The Effects Of Pci On The River Flow Rate Along With The Flow Shortness Volume Values Using Hydrometric And Rain Gauge Stations Within Lub. The Results Obtained From The Changes In River Flow Rate And Flow Shortness Volume Revealed That The River Flow Rate Has Mostly A Falling Trend. Finally, It Was Observed That The Time When The River Flow Rate Data Changed Happened After Beginning Of Changes In The Precipitation Data. A Decrease In Inflow From 900 Million Cubic Meters Up To 14 Billion Cubic Meters With High Flow Shortness Volume May Happen In Worst Conditions. These Results Highlighted The Importance Of Applying Water Resources Management In Lub. 2019, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Austria, Part Of Springer Nature.

To This Purpose, 42 Rain Gauge And 25 Hydrometric Stations Were Selected In Lake Urmia Basin During The Statistical Period Of 19842013. The Results Of Studying The Precipitation Changes In The Lub Indicated That This Basin Experienced A Combination Of Decreasing And Increasing Trend During The Studied Statistical Period. The Decreasing Precipitation Trend Was Often Observed At West And Southwest Stations Of The Basin. The Increasing Trend Was Observed In The Southern And Northeastern Regions. The Results Of Studying The Changes In River Flow Rate Of The Studied Stations In The Lub Indicated That The Trend Of River Flow Rate Is Decreasing In Most Of The Months. At An Annual Scale, The Decreasing Trend Of River Flow Rate Was Also Clearly Observed Across The Basin At All Stations. In Addition, The Decreasing Trend Of River Flow Rate Is More Severe In Autumn And Winter. The Results Of Studying The Time Of Changing Point In The Precipitation Series Showed That The Time Of Changing Point Occurred Between 1992 And 1998 At Most Of The Stations That Experienced A Decreasing Precipitation Trend. The Time Of Changing Point Of River Flow Rate In Lub Occurred Between 1994 And 1998. Two Years After The Reductions In Precipitation, The Decreasing Trend Of River Flow Rate Occurred In The Rivers. 2019, Saudi Society For Geosciences.

The Water Resources Have A Declining Trend And Soils Are Being Saline. Consequently In Order To Investigate The Canola Yield Under Simultaneously Existence Of Salinity And Drought Stress Conditions, An Experiment In The Factorial From And Completely Randomized Blocks Format Was Designed In 3 Replications And Done In Research Field Of Water Engineering Group Of Urmia University During 2012-13 Year In 10 Months. The Water Levels Included 3 Irrigation Treatments: Up To Field Capacity (Fc), 75% Of Fc And 50% Of Fc And Salinity Treatment Were Also Exerted In 3 Levels: Salinity Of Field Soil (Without Salinity Stress), 7 And 14 Ds/M. The Results Showed That The Seed Yield Top Dry Matter And The Weight Of 1000 Seeds Were Decreased Under Water And Salinity Stresses Condition. Naturally Using More Water Mitigates Greatly The Product Declines Due To Salinity Stresses. The Obtained Result Illustrated That Dry Matter With The Maximum Production Amount Of 16.9 Mgr/ Ha, Is More Sensitive To Salinity Stress. Also The Weight Of 1000 Seeds With The Yield Of 3.4 Gr Is More Sensitive To The Water Shortage Than Salinity Stress.

Article	Niknami, Ka//Amirkhiz, Ac//Glascock, Md	Provenance Studies Of Chalcolithic Obsidian Artefacts From Near Lake Urmia, Northwestern Iran Using Wdxrf Analysis	Archaeometry	In 2005-2006 We Initiated A Major Archaeological Survey And Chemical Characterization Study To Investigate The Long-Term Use Of Obsidian Along The Eastern Shores Of Lake Urmia, Northwestern Iran. Previous Research In The Area Suggested That Almost All Archaeological Obsidian Found In This Area Originated From The Nemrut Da Source Located In The Lake Van Region Of Anatolia (Turkey). More Recent Research On Obsidian Artefacts From The Lake Urmia Region Has Identified A Significant Number Of Obsidian Artefacts With Compositions Different From The Sources Near Lake Van. This Suggests That The Obsidian Artefacts Are From A Yet To Be Identified Geological Source, But Possibly One That Was Not Too Distant. In Order To Advance Our Knowledge Of Iranian Obsidians And Eventually Refine Provenance Criteria We Analysed Obsidian From 22 Chalcolithic Sites And Some Source Areas. The Compositions Of Both Obsidian Source Samples And Artefacts Were Determined Using Wave Length Dispersive X-Ray Fluorescence Spectrometry (Wdxrf).

Article	Nouri, H//Mason, Rj//Moradi, N	Land Suitability Evaluation For Changing Spatial Organization In Urmia County Towards Conservation Of Urmia Lake	Applied Geography	One Of The Most Effective Ways To Reverse The Decline Of Iran'S Iconic Urmia Lake Is To Directly Confront The Development Patterns That Have Contributed To The Current Crisis. This Study'S Objective Is To Create A Model For Conservation Of Urmia Lake That Identifies Suitable Lands For Agricultural And Residential Development In Urmia County That Are Distant From Urmia Lake. This Was Accomplished Through A Geographic Information System-Based Multi-Stage Process. The First Step Involved Production Of Maps Based On An Initial Assessment Of The Region'S Geography, Geomorphology, Landforms, And Hazards Potential. In The Next Step, All Of The Parameters Were Overlaid And Land Suitability Maps Were Generated By Using Determinant Maps. In Developing The Final Map, The Lands Were Divided Into Four Classes For Future Development Potential: Highly Suitable, Suitable, Marginally Suitable And Not Suitable. The Results Showed That Well Away From Highly Populated Regions Adjacent To Urmia Lake, There Are Highly Suitable And Suitable Lands That Presently Contain 14 And 8 Percent Of Total Settlements, Respectively. The Highly Suitable And Suitable Lands, Which Cover 5.6 And 6.7% Of The Total Area, May Serve As Appropriate Axes For Changing The Traditional Spatial Organization Of The Region, Redirecting Future Development And Consequently Decreasing Ecological Pressure On Lands Close To Urmia Lake As Well As Preventing Further Excessive Usage Of Water Resources In The Region. 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Geographic Information System, Land Suitability, Spatial Organization, Urmia Lake, Assessment Method, Gis, Lake Water, Mapping, Modeling, Nature Conservation, Water Resource, Iran, Lake Urmia, Orumiyeh, West Azerbaijan	10.1016/J.APGEOG.2017.02.006	43842	Scopus	81	2017

In This Study, A New Bankruptcy Approach Is Investigated To Resolve Water Conflicts In The Zarrinehroud River Basin, The Largest And Most Important Sub-Basin Of Lake Urmias Basin In The Northwest Of Iran. The New Bankruptcy Method Is Compared With The Proportional Rule (Pro) And Another Alternative Based On The Cessation Of Irrigated Agriculture In The Region Proposed To Supply And Save Environmentally In Danger Lake Urmia. Four Scenarios Consisting Of The Current Situation, Optimistic, Average And Pessimistic Scenarios Regarding The Future Of Water Resources Of The Basin And Agricultural Developments Were Considered. According To The Results, Both Bankruptcy Rules Helped Lake Urmia To Receive More Water, But Neither Could Utterly Overcome The Water Shortage Of The Lake, So Can Be Used As Supplementary Actions Alongside Other Solutions. The Cessation Of Irrigated Agriculture Throughout The Basin Overcame The Average Annual Shortage Of Lake Urmia In The First And Second Scenarios Equal To 137 And 148 Million Cubic Meters Respectively. It Showed Disability To Fully Supply The Lake In The Third And Fourth Scenarios. These Three Methods Must Be Combined With A Social-Economic Policy Like The Purchase Of Decreased Water Allocations To Farmers To Be Socially Acceptable. 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

During The Past Two Decades, A Significant Water Level Decline Has Occurred In The Lake. The Lake Urmia Tragedy, Which Is Perhaps The Most Disastrous Water Problem Experienced By The Iranians To Date, Occurred Not Only As A Result Of Frequent Droughts And Aggressive Upstream Water Use, Diversion, And Storage But Also Due To The Anthropogenic Effects Of Arrogant And Uncoordinated Upstream Development Activities By Three Provinces In A Competitive Environment. Shrinkage Of The Lake And Constriction Of A Controversial Causeway Over The Lake Have Had Significant Implications For The Lakes Valuable Ecosystem And The Regional Economy. This Chapter Intends To Have Provided The Entire Information To Manage The Lake, Its Ecosystem, And Watershed That May Be Of Immediate Help For The Restoration. The Condition Of Lake Urmia At Present Is An Indisputable Crisis: The Lake Is In An Absolutely Dire Condition And Will Become A Tragedy And A Disaster On A Monumental Scale If Effective Restoration Measures Are Not Enacted Promptly And Correctly. The Urgency And Hemispheric Importance Of Implementing Corrective Measures To Restore The Ecological, Limnological, Recreational, Aesthetic, And Climatic Features Of Lake Urmia Cannot Be Overstated. There Is An Immediate And Pressing Need To Move Forward Quickly And Effectively With The Restoration Of Lake Urmia. 2016 By Taylor & Francis Group, Llc.	Na, Na	10.1201/B22244	605-617	Scopus	NA	2017

Siminehrud Catchment Is A Major Sub-Basin Of Lu Basin And Was Selected To Explore The Methodology. The Results Of Simulations Show That The Catchment Inflow Into The Lake Could Decrease Up To 30% And Agriculture Production Up To 50%. A Number Of Adaptation Strategies Were Examined And It Was Found That Revision Of Cropping Patterns Is The Best Measure To Mitigate The Negative Effect Of Climate Change However, None Of The Strategies Proposed Thus Far Will Maintain The Long-Term Average Inflow Into The Lake At The Current Fig. Of 570 Mcm. The Results Demonstrated The Ability Of Swat To Link With The Oecd Framework And Perform The Required Simulations And Estimations Of Relevant Indicators. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Article	Roshan, G//Samakosh, Jm//Orosa, Ja	The Impacts Of Drying Of Lake Urmia On Changes Of Degree Day Index Of The Surrounding Cities By Meteorological Modelling	Environmental Earth Sciences	The Lake Urmia, The Largest Lake In Iran And The Second Largest Saline Lake In The World, Is Currently Faced With The Threat Of Drying Up. In The Last Two Years, It Experienced An Increase In Its Water Level, Leading Researchers To Compare Different Situations. In This Study, Using The Air Pollution Modelling Software, Two Scenarios, One Of The Lake Being Full Of Water And Another Of The Dry Lake, Were Projected In Order To Simulate Changes In Energy Demand For Four Cities Located In The Neighbourhood Of The Lake. The Main Results, Based On A Dry Lake Scenario, Showed A Decrease In Weather Temperature During The Cold Season And An Increase During The Hot Season, Particularly In The Day Time, In Respect Of A Full Level Of Water In The Lake. Because Of This, There Was An Increase In Energy Demand For Cooling Degree Day (Cdd) For Daily Hours Of The Hot Months And For Heating Degree Day (Hdd) Demand In The Night Hours Of The Cold Months. In Particular, The Overall Average Annual Increase For Hdd And Cdd In The Entire Studied Area Will Increase To 140.56 And 105.90 By Day, Respectively. At The Same Time, A Significant Variation Of Relative Humidity In Contraposition To Temperature Will Occur, Therefore, The Thermal Comfort Conditions Of The Studied Cities Are Expected To Be Worse. Finally, Future Research Works Must Be Done To Predict The Expected Energy Consumption In The Next Decades In Accordance With The Procedure Developed. 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Conference Paper	Sabzehee, F//Nafisi, V//Pour, Si	Investigation On The Urmia Lake Drought Using Satellite Altimetry And Weather Reanalysis Products	International Archives Of The Photogrammetry, Remote Sensing And Spatial Information Sciences - Isprs Archives	The Urmia Lake Is Located In Northwestern Iran. It Is The Sixth Largest Salt Lake In The World. In The Past 14 Years, This Lake Strongly Faced To The Water Level Decrease And Surface Water Reduction. Several Space-Borne Techniques Have Been Employed For Detecting The Hydrological Cycle And Its Inter-Annual Changes. The Goal Of This Paper Is To Investigate Weather Reanalysis Products Such As Specific Humidity Of Ncep Model And A Total Column Water Vapor Extracted From Ecmwf Model And Other Techniques Such As Satellite Altimetry That Have Been Powerful For The Identification Of Some Drought Factors Of The Urmia Lake. In This Study, We Used Satellite Altimetry Data From Envisat And Cryosat-2 To Monitor The Lake Water Level And Optical Satellite Imagery To Determine The Surface Water Extent Of The Lake During 2002 To 2014. Our Altimetry And Satellite Imagery Results Reveal Decrease In Height And Area Of Urmia Lake Over The Last 14 Years. The Lake Surface Area And The Water Level Decreased Continuously At Approximately 2666 Km2 And 3.5 M Respectively. Moreover, We Employed The Monthly 0.1250.125 Datasets Of The Ecmwf Data And 2.52.5 Datasets Of The Ncep Data To Demonstrate Amount Of Water Vapor In The Atmosphere Over The Lake. The Total Column Water Vapor Extracted From Ecmwf Data And Specific Humidity Of Ncep Data Show Similar Behavior. Results Indicate That No Meaningful Correlation Between The Altimetry Data And Weather Reanalysis Models Exists. The Weather Reanalysis Models Do Not Indicate Descending Variations During 2000 Until 2014. For Interpreting The Situation And Studying The Climate Change And Man-Made Impacts On The Drought In This Region, We Need To Use Ground-Based Data Such As Wind Speed, Precipitation, Barometric Pressure And Temperature.

Article	Sadeghi, V//Farnood, Ahmadi, F//Ebadi, H	Design And Implementation Of An Expert System For Updating Thematic Maps Using Satellite Imagery (Case Study: Changes Of Lake Urmia)	Arabian Journal Of Geosciences	Thematic Maps Are Fundamental For Decision-Making In Natural Resources And Ecosystem Management And Planning. Thematic Information, Land Cover In Particular, Is Dynamic And Changeable With The Passage Of Time. Hence, Providing Up-To-Date And Precise Data In A Short Period Of Time Is Considered As A Key Factor For Successful Utilization Of These Maps. Field Inspection And Visual Interpretation Of Satellite Images And Topographic Maps Are Necessary For This Purpose. These Processes Are Labor Intensive, Time Consuming, And Costly. An Expert System, As A Computer System With The Capability Of An Experts Performance Simulation, Could Be An Assistant For Experts Involved With The Thematic Map Updating Process. In This Paper, A Knowledge-Based Expert (Kbe) System Was Designed, Implemented, And Tested To Automate, Facilitate, And Expedite The Conventional Thematic Map Updating Procedure. The Developed System In This Research Is Based On Using Existing Thematic Map And Satellite Images Together With The New Acquired Satellite Image Of The Desired Region. It Entails The Following Five Major Steps: (1) Relative Radiometric Normalization, (2) Change Detection, (3) Spectral Database Construction, (4) Identifying The Content Of The Changes, And (5) Cartographic Operations. In Order To Assess The Effectiveness Of The Proposed Kbe System For Automatic Updating Of Thematic Maps, Two Different Case Studies Related To Urmia Lake And Surrounding Areas Were Considered. Near-Anniversary Bi-Temporal Landsat Tm 4,5 Imagery, Acquired On 30 June 1989 And 24 June 2007 Over The Eastern Coast Of The Lake Alongside The Existing Land Cover Map Of 1989, Were Used In The First Case Study. Utilized Data Sets In The Second Case Study Were Near-Anniversary Landsat 8 Satellite Images (Oli Sensor) Taken On 20/7/2014 And 23/7/2015 Over The Southern Coast Of Lake Alongside The Outdated Land Cover Map Of Interest Region In 2014. Test Results Of Different Parts Of The System Were Confirmed By The Experts, And Finally The System Could Satisfy The Assessment Criteria From The Experts Point Of View In This Particular Application. Overall Accuracy Of The Updated Thematic Map In The First And Second Case Studies Was 97.18 And 87.81%, Respectively. 2016, Saudi Society For Geosciences.

Article	Safavi, S//Shamsai, A//Saghafian, B	Reduced-Order Salinity Modeling Of The Urmia Lake Using Mike3 And Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Models	Water Resources	Increasing Salinity In Urmia Lake, Located In The North-West Of Iran, Has Turned Into A Critical Issue, Particularly Because The Lake Is The Habitat Of A Unique Multi-Cellular Organism Called Artemia Urmiana. During The Past Decades, Several Anthropogenic Changes Have Taken Place In The Lake, Which Have Resulted In Increased Salinity. This Study Introduces A Reduced-Order Framework Based On Mike3 Simulation Model And Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (Pod) To Simulate Salinity Patterns In Urmia Lake. Spatio-Temporal Variations Of Salinity In The Lake Firstly Were Simulated By Mike3, And Close Matches Were Observed Between Salinity Estimates From Mike3 And Those Of The Field Data. Thereafter, 365 Daily Snapshots Were Taken From Mike3 Simulations, And Subsequently 365 Pod Basis Modes Were Computed. Due To High Percentage Of Conserved Energy Of The Lake System (Salinity Of Lake) Within The First Ten Pod Basis Modes, These Modes Were Considered To Develop A Reduced-Order Salinity Model (Rosm). Finally, Results From Mike3 Were Compared With The Rosm. It Was Shown That The First Ten Modes (Among 365 Modes) Obtained By The Pod Conserved Approximately More Than 99.8% Of The Energy Of The System. Moreover, Using The First Ten Modes Resulted In An Error In Magnitude Of Less Than 0.01. Therefore, The Rosm Could Successfully Capture The Variations Of Salinity In The Lake Via Its First Ten Modes. 2018, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.

Article	Salehi, Bavil, S//Zeinalzadeh, K//Hessari, B	The Changes In The Frequency Of Daily Precipitation In Urmia Lake Basin, Iran	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	Urmia Lake, As One Of The Most Valuable Saline Ecosystems In The World, Has Faced A Sharp Drop In The Water Level In Recent Years. The Trend Studies Of Climatic Parameters Can Be Effective In Identifying The Responsible Factors And Managing This Crisis. This Research Investigated The Frequency Trend Of Daily Precipitation In The Ranges Of Less Than 5Mm, 510Mm, 1015Mm, 1520Mm, And More Than 20Mm In The Urmia Lake Basin. The Trend Was Assessed Using Mann-Kendall, Spearman Rho And Linear Regression Tests On 60 Stations During A Period Of 30Years (1981 To 2011). The Results Showed That In All The Three Tests, The Frequency Of Daily Precipitation Of Less Than 5Mm Had A Significant Increase At 1% Level. The 510Mm Range Displayed No Significant Trend, While The 1015Mm Range Showed A Significantly Decreasing Trend. The Frequency In The 1520Mm And Above 20Mm Ranges Showed An Insignificant Falling Trend. The Analysis Also Indicated Jumps In 1996 And 1999 (Almost Coinciding With The Sharp Drop In The Lakes Water Level). In Other Words, The Frequency Trends Of Daily Precipitation With Small Amounts (As A Result, High Evapotranspiration Loss) Were Increasing And With Large Amounts Were Decreasing. This Can Be A Contributor To Reduced Run-Off And, Hence, Decreased Water Entering The Lake. The Results Emphasize The Need For Changes In The Management And Consumption Of Water Resources In The Basin, In Order To Adapt To The Climatic Change. 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

During Last Years, Environmental Situation Of Lake Urmia With All Its Geological, Economic, Social, Water Resources, Climate And Other Aspects, Has Changed And Followed A Downward Trend. Lake Urmia, As A Public Good, Needs Public Contribution To Prevent Further Deterioration. The Success Of Restoration Strategies Is Largely Dependent On Its Acceptance By The Beneficiaries And Level Of Their Participation. The Purpose Of This Paper Is To Conduct A Choice Experiment For Investigating Public Heterogeneous Preferences On The Non-Market Economic Benefits Of Lake Urmia Restoration. A Scale-Adjusted Multilevel Latent Class Model Is Applied And A Model With Three Latent Classes At Individual Level, Two Classes At Group Level And Two Scale Classes Was Selected As The Preferred Model. According To Our Results, Most People Who Live Geographically Closer To Lake Urmia, Belong To The Same Grand Class. There Were Signs Of Homogeneity For All Members Of This Grand Class, While For Other Respondents, Considerable Heterogeneity Could Be Observed. We Have Evidence From Our Results That Individuals' Characteristics, Location And Response Certainty May Provide Explanations For Heterogeneity. 2018 Universitatea Alexandru Ioan Cuza Din Iasi.

This Paper Contributes To The Discussion On The Functioning Of These Organisations And, More Specifically, On The Relationship Between Their Institutional Design And Their Performance. An In-Depth Case Study Of The Urmia Lake Restoration National Committee (Ulrnc) In Iran Reveals That The Committee Has Been Successful In Drafting Ambitious Plans And Policies For Restoring Urmia Lake. However, There Is A Serious Risk Of Implementation Failure Due To Contradictory National Policy Agendas Of Lake Restoration And Agricultural Development, Insufficient Budget Allocation For Realising The Restoration Plan, Lack Of Provincial Accountability For The Spending Of Resources Made Available For The Implementation Of Restoration Measures, And Potential Future Political Instability Which May Lead To Less Attention To The Restoration Process. 2019 Water Alternatives.

In The First Part Of This Paper, The Climate Model Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (Lars-Wg) Was Used For Downscaling Climate Data Including Rainfall, Solar Radiation, And Minimum And Maximum Temperatures. Two Different Case Studies Including Aji-Chay And Mahabad-Chay River Basins As Sub-Basins Of Lake Urmia In The Northwest Part Of Iran Were Considered. The Results Indicated That The Lars-Wg Successfully Downscaled The Climatic Variables. By Application Of Different Emission Scenarios (I.E., A1B, A2, And B1), An Increasing Trend In Rainfall And A Decreasing Trend In Temperature Were Predicted For Both The Basins Over Future Time Periods. In The Second Part Of This Paper, Gene Expression Programming (Gep) Was Applied For Simulating Runoff Of The Basins In The Future Time Periods Including 2020, 2055, And 2090. The Input Combination Including Rainfall, Solar Radiation, And Minimum And Maximum Temperatures In Current And Prior Time Was Selected As The Best Input Combination With Highest Predictive Power For Runoff Prediction. The Results Showed That The Peak Discharge Will Decrease By 50 And 55.9% In 2090 Comparing With The Baseline Period For The Aji-Chay And Mahabad-Chay Basins, Respectively. The Results Indicated That The Sustainable Adaptation Strategies Are Necessary For These Basins For Protection Of Water Resources In Future. 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.

Usually, Assessment Of Surface Water Quality Is Costly And Time-Consuming. In This Situation, A Method Which Could Estimate The Water Quality Accurately With The Minimum Of Hydro-Chemical Parameters Would Be Appealing. In This Study, Three Data Mining Methods, Namely, M5 Model Tree, Support Vector Machine (Svm), And Gaussian Process (Gp), Were Employed To Estimate The Sodium Adsorption Ratio (Sar) Indicator In The Shahrchay River Located In The West Of The Urmia Lake Basin, Iran. Results From These Methods Were Compared With An Artificial Neural Network (Ann). Different Hydro-Chemical Parameters Were Assessed And The Most Effective Parameters Were Selected. Five Combinations Of The Selected Parameters Were Developed As Input Parameters To The Models. The Results Indicated That The M5 Model Tree Has A Superior Performance Among The Data Mining Methods, Where The Combination Of Sodium And Electrical Conductivity (Na And Ec) Is Used As Input Parameters, With A Coefficient Of Determination (R 2 )=0.987, Root Mean Squared Error (Rmse)=0.017, Mean Absolute Error (Mae)=0.012, And Mean Relative Error (Mre)=5.584. Also, A Sensitivity Analysis Was Carried Out Which Reported That The Sar Is More Sensitive To Na, Ca, And Ec, Respectively. This Research Highlights That The M5 Model Tree Can Be Successfully Employed For The Estimation Of Sar.

This Paper Describes The Desktop Assessment Of Environmental Flows In A River With Insufficient Data On Ecological Features And Values. In This Study, The Potential Environmental Flows In A Typical River Reach Of The Shahr Chai River In Iran Were Investigated Using A Newly Developed Hydrological Method (Flow Duration Curve (Fdc) Shifting) And Global Environmental Flow Calculator Software. This Approach Uses Monthly Flow Data To Develop An Environmental Fdc And To Generate Flow Requirements Corresponding To Different Features Of The River Ecosystem. Results Were Compared With Those From Four Alternative Hydrological Methods: The Desktop Reserve Model (Drm), Tennant, Low-Flow Index, And Flow Duration Curve Analysis (Fdca). Comparisons Of These Methods Indicated That To Maintain The Basic Function Of The River Ecosystem, The River Flows Should Be Managed Within An Acceptable Environmental Level. The Predictions From The Tennant Method And The Low-Flow Index (7-Day Low Flow With A 10-Year Return Period), And From The Fdca (For Flows Exceeding 90 % Of Occurrence) Are Not As Reliable As Those From The Fdc Shifting Technique And Drm. Comparative Results Indicate That A Minimum Flow Rate Of 1.2 M 3/S (Equivalent To 23 % Of The Natural Mean Annual Runoff, Or Flow With 80 % Occurrence Depicted From The Fdc) Is Required For The Shahr Chai River To Run Toward The Internationally Recognized Urmia Lake In Iran.

The Limitation Of This Energy Has Been Reported To Be 0.192 Kwh/M3 Of The Mixed Solution When Using Seawater As The Saline Source, Which Could Limit The Potential Of The Technology. However, Using Hypersaline Water Sources Allows For Higher Energy Densities, And Could Be A Way To Make Pro Viable. Lake Urmia In Iran Is The Second Largest Hypersaline Lake In The World, And In This Study, The Pro Potential Has Been Evaluated. An Energy Potential Between 250 And 1,250 Mw Depending On The Freshwater Source Was Calculated By Using A Newly Developed Mixing Model. The Results Of A New Model Were Compared With Previously Reported Energy Potentials Of Lake Urmia Calculated With Simplified Models. Based On Our Analysis The Madsens Model Predicts Approximately Two Times Higher Energy Production Over These Models, Showing That A Hypersaline Pro Plant At Lake Urmia Could Be A Significant Producer Of Renewable Energy In The Region. Finally, The Sensitivity Analysis For Membrane Revenue Based On The Fluctuation Of The Retail Price Of Electricity Has Been Carried Out.

Microbial Sources Are The Best Source For The Bulk Production Of These Enzymes. However, Their Long-Term Administration May Cause Immunological Responses, So Screening For New Enzymes With Novel Properties Is Required. Halophilic And Halotolerant Bacteria With Novel Enzymatic Characteristics Can Be Considered As A Potential Source For Production Of Enzymes With Different Immunological Properties. In This Study, L-Asparaginase And L-Glutaminase Production By Halophilic Bacteria Isolated From Urmia Salt Lake Was Studied. Out Of The 85 Isolated Halophilic And Halotolerant Bacterial Strains, 16 (19 %) Showed L-Asparaginase Activity And 3 Strains (3.5 %) Showed L-Glutaminase Activity. Strains With The Highest Activities Were Selected For Further Studies. Based On 16S Rdna Sequence Analysis, It Was Shown That The Selected Isolates For L-Asparaginase And L-Glutaminase Production Belong To The Genus Bacillus And Salicola, Respectively. Both Enzymes Were Produced Extracellularly. The Strain With The Most L-Asparaginase Production Did Not Show L-Glutaminase Production Which Is Medically Important. The Effects Of Key Parameters Including Temperature, Initial Ph Of The Solution, And Concentrations Of Glucose, Asparagine Or Glutamine, And Sodium Chloride Were Evaluated By Means Of Response Surface Methodology (Rsm) To Optimize Enzymes Production.

The Wst Of Urmia Lake In Northwestern Iran Was Examined From 2007 To 2010, Using Modis Land Surface Temperature (Lst) Products. Spatial And Temporal (Diurnal, Monthly, Seasonal And Inter-Annual) Variations Of Urmia Lake Wst Were Also Investigated. Results Indicate That The Modis-Derived Wsts Are In A Good Agreement With The In Situ Data (R2=0.92 And Bias=-0.27). Spatial Analysis Of Wst Revealed That There Are Three Thermal Zones Along The Lake: The Shallow Region In Barriers Of The Causeway, Islands And The Shoreline, The South Part, And The Deep North Parts. Using Validated Modis-Derived Wst, The Annual Temperature Cycles Of Urmia Lake Were Extracted And Quadratic Curves Were Fitted To Empirically Display The Monthly Lake-Averaged Variations Of The Lake Wst. Then The Effect Of Including The Spatial Distribution Of Wst On The Lake Evaporation Was Assessed. According To The Results Of The Energy Balance Method, A 147Mm/Year (515Millionm3) Discrepancy Can Be Expected In The Estimated Evaporation Rate When The Spatial Distribution In The Lake Wst Is Considered In The Energy Balance Equation. Findings Of This Study Confirm The Application Of Modis Lst Products For Surface Temperature Studies In A Large Hyper-Saline Lake.

Spore And An Extracellular Enzyme From A Halotolerant Spore-Forming Bacterium, Bacillus Sp. Strain Wt, Showed Laccase Activity Toward Typical Laccase Substrates: Syringaldazine And 2, 2-Azino-Bis (3-Ethylbenzothiazoline-6-Sulfonate). The Extracellular Laccase (0.01Uml1) Decolorized Sulphonyl Green Ble Up To 97% At Ph 7.0 After Two H Incubation At 35C, Without Any Addition Of Mediators. This Enzyme With Apparent Molecular Mass Of 180Kda Was Purified Using Ammonium Sulfate Precipitation Method And Anion Exchange Chromatography. The Optimum Laccase Activity Toward 2, 2-Azino-Bis (3-Ethylbenzothiazoline-6-Sulfonate) And Syringaldazine Was At 55C And Ph Values Of 5.0 And 8.0, Respectively. One Mm Of Metal Ions, Na+ And Ni2+, Increased The Enzyme Activity By 12%. The Enzyme From Bacillus Sp. Strain Wt Could Be Able To Tolerate Up To 600800Mm Nacl (A Very Strong Laccase Inhibitor) And Showed Halotolerant Nature With Maximum Activity At 100Mm Nacl. One Mm Nan3 (Another Potent Laccase Inhibitor) Almost Had No Effect On The Laccase Activity, However, 1Mm L-Cys Reduced 87% Of Its Original Activity. Km Values For The Purified Enzyme On 2, 2-Azino-Bis (3-Ethylbenzothiazoline-6-Sulfonate) And Syringaldazine Were Determined To Be 132.7 And 3.7M, With Corresponding Kcat Values Of 309 And 51S1, Respectively. The Present Study Is Among The First Studies On Laccase Activity Of A Halotolerant Bacterial Strain Isolated From A Hypersaline Lake. 2016 Elsevier B.V.

Article	Sobhani, B//Zengir, Vs//Kianian, Mk	Drought Monitoring In The Lake Urmia Basin In Iran	Arabian Journal Of Geosciences	Drought Is A Reptile Phenomenon That Is Caused By Rising Temperatures And Decreasing Rainfall Than Normal. This Phenomenon Has A Significant Impact On The Human Lives And Other Organisms. We Tried To Study The Drought Status By Using The Matlab Software And Integrated Sepi In Two 3- And 9-Month Scale In The Lake Of Urmia. For This Purpose, We Used The Climate Data Of 5 Synoptic Stations Of Lake Urmia (Tabriz, Maragheh, Urmia, Saghez, Mahabad). The Findings Of The Study Indicate That The Standardized Evapotranspiration And Precipitation Index (Sepi) Reflects The Characteristics Of Both The Standardized Precipitation Index (Spi) And Standardized Evapotranspiration Index (Sei) Indicators, And Also Introduces The Temperature As One Of The Effective Parameters In The Change Of Drought Severity In Drought Conditions, Therefore, The Study Of Drought Using Sepi Is Better Than That Using Spi. Drought Investigation Indicates That The Drought Trend Is Increasing Based On Sepi In The Lake Urmia. Temperature Is Also Increasing More Intensively. The Longest Period Of Drought Persistence Occurred At The Urmia Station On A 3-Month Scale From June To December 1995 To December 2016 For 24 Months In The Lake Urmia Basin. The Highest Drought Incidence Rate Was Observed At The Saghez Station At The 3-Month Scale And The Lowest In Maragheh. 2019, Saudi Society For Geosciences.

Article	Sotoudeheian, S//Salim, R//Arhami, M	Impact Of Middle Eastern Dust Sources On Pm10 In Iran: Highlighting The Impact Of Tigris-Euphrates Basin Sources And Lake Urmia Desiccation	Journal Of Geophysical Research	Contribution Of Different Middle Eastern Dust Origins To Pm10 (Pm With Aerodynamic Diameters Less Than 10 M) Levels In Several Receptor Large Cities In Iran Was Investigated. Initially, The Major Regional Dust Episodes Were Determined Through Statistical Analysis Of Recorded Pm Levels At Air Quality Stations And Verified Using Satellite Images. The Particles Dispersion Was Simulated By Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (Hysplit) To Regenerate Pm10 During The Dust Episodes. The Accuracy Of The Modeled Results Was Rather Convincing, With An Average Squared Correlation Coefficient (R2) Of 0.7 (Max=0.95). Consequently, The Contributions Of Different Dust Sources To The Observed Concentrations Were Determined. Basin Of Tigris-Euphrates Rivers Encompasses Active Dust Sources With Significant Rate Of Emission Due To Fluvial Deposits. The Sources In This Basin With Approximately 70-95% Contribution, By Far, Had The Most Influence On Pm10 Levels At The Receptor Cities. In A Finer Resolution, Northern And Central Parts Of Iraq Had The Most Influence On Pm10 Level During The Dust Episodes. Effect Of Probable Improvement Or Deterioration Of The Current Dust Origin Conditions On Pm10 Levels Was Analyzed By Performing A Sensitivity Analysis Through Varying Threshold Friction Velocities. The Results Demonstrated That 10% Increase Or Decrease In Threshold Friction Velocities Of Major Dust Sources Could Lead To Average Of 51% Decrease Or 77% Increase In The Receptor Cities Pm10, Respectively. Finally, Effects Of Lake Urmia Desiccation, As A New Hydrological Prospect Dust Origin Were Analyzed. The Predicted Dust From The Prospective Dried Lake Bed Could Result In ~ 30-60% Increase In Pm10 Of Nearby Cities During The Studied Dust Episodes. 2016. American Geophysical Union.

Article	Vaheddoost, B//Aksoy, H//Abghari, H	Prediction Of Water Level Using Monthly Lagged Data In Lake Urmia, Iran	Water Resources Management	Prediction Of Water Level Fluctuations In Lakes Is A Necessary Task In Hydrological And Limnological Studies. Lake Urmia, A Hyper-Saline Lake In The North Western Part Of Iran, Is Dealing With A Gradual Atrophy. In This Study, Parametric And Nonparametric Models Are Used For Predicting Monthly Water Level Fluctuations In Lake Urmia. Eleven Previous Water Levels In The Form Of Monthly Lagged Data Are Used As The Known Independent Variables Of The Model While Lake Water Level At The Twelfth Month Is Considered As The Unknown Dependent Variable To Be Predicted. Parametric Models Used In The Modelling Are Multi-Linear Regression (Mlr), Additive And Multiplicative Non-Linear Regression (Anlr And Mnlr) And Decision Tree (Dt) While Feed Forward Back Propagation Neural Network (Ffbp-Nn), Generalized Regression Neural Network (Gr-Nn) And Radial Basis Function Neural Network (Rbf-Nn) Are Used To Represent The Non-Parametric Approach. Monthly Water Level Data In Lake Urmia Observed For 19662010 Are Used For The Case Study. Four Criteria, Coefficient Of Determination, Lins Concordance Correlation Coefficient, Performance Index And Root Mean Square Percentage Error Are Used In Comparison Of The Models. The First Two Are Considered For The Success Of The Models While The Last Two For The Failure. Success Criteria Are Given A Grade Between 0 And 10, Failure Criteria Receive A Grade From 10 To 0. The Summation Of The Grades Is Taken As The Total Grade Of Each Model. It Is Found That Regression Models And Ffbp-Nn Are Superior To Gr-Nn, Rbf-Nn And Dt In Predicting Monthly Lake Water Level. 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

The High Levels Of These Impurities In Urmia Lake Would Create Difficulties During Lithium Processing If Conventional Techniques Were Used. To This End, The Spinel-Type Mno2Nanorod, With The Size About 40-90 Nm In Diameter And 150-900 Nm In Length, Was First Synthesized As A Lithium Ion Sieve Via A Hydrothermal Method. The Lithium Uptake Capacity Of This Synthesized Ion Sieve Reached To 9 Mmolg- 1, Which Is The Maximum Value Among The Adsorbents Studied To Date. The Crystalline Structure, Property And Size Of All Products Involving Oxidizer, Precursor And Ion Sieve Are Examined Via Powder X-Ray Diffraction (Xrd), Scanning Electron Microscopy (Sem) And Transmission Electron Microscopy (Tem). Also The Lithium Selective Adsorption Property Was Investigated By Measuring The Distribution Coefficients (Kd) Of A Series Of Alkaline And Alkaline-Earth Metal Ions, Which Is Significant For Lithium Extraction From Aqueous Solutions With Very Low Lithium Content. Furthermore, The Results Show That The Synthesized Mno2Nanorods Could Be Utilized In Lithium Extraction From Urmia Lake Brine And Other Environments Including Sea Water And Waste Water. 2014 Elsevier B.V.

Article	Zeinoddini, M//Bakhtiari, A//Ehteshami, M	Long-Term Impacts From Damming And Water Level Manipulation On Flow And Salinity Regimes In Lake Urmia, Iran	Water And Environment Journal	Lake Urmia In The North-West Of Iran Is Very Large, Very Shallow And Several Times More Saline Than Ocean Water. The Salinity Of This Terminal Lake Is Of Great Ecological Consequence For The Existence And Growth Of Artemiaurmiana, A Unique Zooplankton Endemic To The Lake. It Is A Main Food Source For Large Bird Populations. During The Past Decades, Lake Urmia Has Been Strained By A Number Of Anthropogenic And Natural Causes. They Include Extensive Damming On The Contributory Rivers, Building A Dike-Type Causeway And Climate Change. This Paper Deals With The Long-Term Impacts Of Damming, Fresh Water Overexploitation And Water Level Manipulation On Flow And Salinity Conditions In Lake Urmia. For This Purpose, The Flow And Salinity Regimes Were Numerically Simulated For The Next Four Decades. The Validity Of The Pseudo-Three-Dimensional Hydrodynamic And Advection-Dispersion Models Was Assessed Through Sensitivity Analysis Of The Models And Comparing The Simulated Results Against Field Measurements. The Model Predicted That Because Of Damming On The Rivers, The Mean Water Level In The Lake Will Possibly Experience A Drop Of 2.2-2.8M Over Next 40 Years. The Results Indicated That, Over Decadal Time Periods, The Lake Most Probably Will Be Split Into Two Interconnected Smaller Lakes. The Northern Lake Was Foreseen To Become Extremely Saline, Which Will Seriously Threaten The Artemia'S Survival In This Area. Over The Long-Term Periods, The Southern Lake Seemed Not To Deviate Much From Its Existing Conditions. It However Appeared To Become More Responsive To Seasonal Climatic Changes And To The Rivers Inflow, As Compared With Its Current Conditions. Effects From Climate Changes Were Not Considered In The Current Study. 2014 Ciwem.

Article	Zeinoddini, M//Bakhtiari, A//Ehteshami, M	Wave-Flow Coupling Effects On Spatiotemporal Variations Of Flow And Salinity In A Large Hypersaline Marine System: Lake Urmia, Iran	Limnology	On Many Occasions, The Effects Of Wind-Induced Waves And Currents On Flow And Salinity Fields In Water Bodies Are Evaluated Separately. Some Coupling Mechanisms Of The Two Phenomena, However, Can Have A Significant Impact On The Flow And Salinity Conditions, In Particular In Sensitive Aquatic Ecosystems. This Article Attempts To Quantify The Wave Contributions To The Flow And Salinity Regimes In Lake Urmia, Iran. The Salinity Conditions In The Lake Have Become An Environmentally Important Subject, Partly Because This Shallow Hypersaline Aquatic Ecosystem Is Considered To Be One Of The Largest Natural Habitats Of A Unique Multicellular Organism, Artemia Urmiana. This Brine Shrimp Is The Major Food Source For Many Of The Protected And Rare Shorebirds That Visit The Lake And Can Grow And Survive In Only Certain Ranges Of Salinity. The Lake Has Also Experienced Considerable Man-Made Changes During The Past Three Decades. Previous Studies That Have Modeled The Flow And Salinity Regimes In The Lake Have Overlooked The Wave-Coupling Effects, And Some Have Concluded That Major Remedial Actions Are Necessary To Restore The Lake Ecosystem. The Wave-Coupling Effects Were Found To Have Significant Impacts On The Spatiotemporal Variations Of Flow And Salinity In The Lake. Wave Actions Were Intensifying Vertical Stratification, Considerably Influencing The Flow And Salinity Regimes. It Was Found That Improvements In The Lake Salinity Conditions Provided By The Wave Actions Were Comparable To Potential Improvements That Expensive Mitigation Scenarios May Offer. The Relative Magnitude Of The Wave Coupling Was Found To Be The Highest In Shallow/Large Water Bodies, And It Increased As The Wave Height And The Initial Salinity Increased, Suggesting That These Wave-Coupling Effects Are Substantial, Especially In Large, Shallow, Hypersaline Lakes. 2012 The Japanese Society Of Limnology.

Article	Zeinoddini, M//Tofighi, Ma//Bakhtiari, A	Assessment Of 2Dh And Pseudo-3D Modelling Platforms In A Large Saline Aquatic System: Lake Urmia, Iran	Hydrological Processes	The Main Objective Of This Paper Is To Provide Comparative Quantitative Examinations On The Capabilities Of Two-Dimensional Horizontal And Pseudo-Three-Dimensional (3D) Modelling Approaches For Simulating Spatial And Temporal Variability Of The Flow And Salinity In Lake Urmia, Iran. The Water Quality In The Lake Has Been An Environmentally Important Subject Partly Because This Shallow Hypersaline Aquatic Ecosystem Is Considered To Be One Of The Largest Natural Habitats Of A Unique Multicellular Organism, Artemia Urmiana. This Brine Shrimp Is The Major Food Source For Many Of The Protected And Rare Shorebirds That Visit The Lake. A.Urmiana Can Grow And Survive In Certain Ranges Of Salinity, And Their Disappearance Could Lead To An Alteration Of Existing Equilibria. The Lake Has Also Experienced Considerable Man-Made Changes During The Past Three Decades. A Newly Built Crossing Embankment Almost Divided The Lake Into Two Northern And Southern Halves. A Relatively Small Opening Of 1.25Km In The New Embankment Provides Water Connections Between The Two Halves. As A Result, The Flow And Salinity Regimes Have Been Significantly Changed. This Might Have Had Adverse Serious Impacts On The Lake Ecosystem. In The Current Study, The Two-Dimensional Horizontal Hydrodynamic Model Has Been Found To Provide Reasonable Predictions For The Flow Regime In The Lake, Whereas Its Salinity Predictions Have Not Been Consistent With The Field Observations. The Pseudo-3D Model Has Produced Results Fairly Close To The Salinity Measurements And Its Temporal And Spatial Variations. The Pseudo-3D Model Has Been Used For Evaluating The Embankment Effects On The Lake Hydrodynamics And On The Salinity Conditions. The Effectiveness Of Introducing A Different Number Or Length Of Openings In The Embankment For Restoring The Pre-Embankment Conditions Has Also Been Examined. These Remedy Options Have Been Found Not To Offer Substantial Improvements To The Lake'S Existing Ecosystem. 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Article	Zeinoddini, M//Tofighi, Ma//Vafaee, F	Evaluation Of Dike-Type Causeway Impacts On The Flow And Salinity Regimes In Urmia Lake, Iran	Journal Of Great Lakes Research	Urmia Lake, Located In A Closed Basin In North-West Iran, Is The Largest Lake (5000-6000Km2) In The Middle East. It Is Very Saline With Total Dissolved Salts Reaching 200G/L Compared With A Normal Seawater Salinity Of About 35G/L. The Construction Of A Causeway, Which Was Initiated In 1979 But Then Abandoned Until The Early 2000S, Is Near Completion And Will Provide Road Access Between The Western And Eastern Provinces. The Causeway Has An Opening 1.25Km Long And Divides Urmia Lake Into A Northern And Southern Basin And Restricts Water Exchange. The Flow And Salinity Regimes Are Affected By The Presence Of This New Causeway, And There Are Concerns Over The Well Being Of The Artemia Population. This Study Investigates The Effects Of The Construction Of The Causeway On Flow And Salinity Regimes, Considers Remedial Actions, And Examines The Effects Of Climatic Variability On Salinity And Flow. Flow And Salinity Regimes Were Numerically Simulated By Using A Commercially Available Two And Three-Dimensional (2D And 3D) Mike Model. The Validity Of The Numerical Model Was Assessed Through Sensitivity Analysis Of The Model And Comparing The Simulated Results Against Field Measurements, The 3D Model Provided The Higher Correlation Between Simulated And Actual Data. Wind Input Was The Main Climatic And Hydrologic Factor Influencing Flow Regime While River Discharge, Evaporation And Rainfall Were The Key Parameters Affecting Salinity Distribution In The Lake Models. The 3D Model Was Subsequently Used To Predict Lake Conditions In Typical Dry, Wet And Normal Climates, To Examine The Environmental Impacts From The New Causeway, And To Evaluate Possible Improvements That Some Remedial Measures May Provide. 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Article	Abbaspour, M//Nazaridoust, A	Determination Of Environmental Water Requirements Of Lake Urmia, Iran: An Ecological Approach	International Journal Of Environmental Studies	Lake Urmia Is A Thalassohaline Ecosystem. It Is An Extremely Simple Ecological Pyramid. This Makes It A Very Sensitive Ecosystem. This Ecosystem Has Been Facing Various Threats Regarding The Amount Of Water Released From The Associated Basin. To Calculate The Lake Water Requirement With An Ecological Approach, We Identified Three Variables: Ecology, Water Quality, And Water Quantity Indices As Environmental Indicators. The Ecological Index Represented By Artemia Urmiana Is Considered As An Independent Variable, While, The Water Quality Index Represented By Concentration Of Nacl, And The Water Quantity Index Represented By Water Elevation Are Regarded As Dependent Variables. The Salinity Threshold Of 240 Ppt (Parts Per Thousand) Is Selected As The Water Quality Requirement For Artemia Urmiana. Finally, The Aggregation Of These Variables Shows That Lake Urmia Requires Annually 3086 Mcm Of Inflow Water To Have A Sustainable Ecosystem. 2007 Taylor & Francis.

Article	Abdi, R//Yasi, M	Evaluation Of Environmental Flow Requirements Using Eco-Hydrologic-Hydraulic Methods In Perennial Rivers	Water Science And Technology	The Assessment Of Environmental Flows In Rivers Is Of Vital Importance For Preserving Riverine Ecosystem Processes. This Paper Addresses The Evaluation Of Environmental Flow Requirements In Three Reaches Along A Typical Perennial River (The Zab Transboundary River, In North-West Iran), Using Different Hydraulic, Hydrological And Ecological Methods. The Main Objective Of This Study Came From The Construction Of Three Dams And Inter-Basin Transfer Of Water From The Zab River To The Urmia Lake. Eight Hydrological Methods (I.E. Tennant, Tessman, Flow Duration Curve Analysis, Range Of Variability Approach, Smakhtin, Flow Duration Curve Shifting, Desktop Reserve And 7Q2&10 (7-Day Low Flow With A 2- And 10-Year Return Period)), Two Hydraulic Methods (Slope Value And Maximum Curvature), And Two Habitat Simulation Methods (Hydraulic-Ecologic, And Q Equation Based On Water Quality Indices) Were Used. Ecological Needs Of The Riverine Key Species (Mainly Barbus Capito Fish), River Geometries, Natural Flow Regime And The Environmental Status Of River Management Were The Main Indices For Determining The Minimum Flow Requirements. The Results Indicate That The Order Of 35%, 17% And 18% Of The Mean Annual Flow Are To Be Maintained For The Upper, Middle And Downstream River Reaches, Respectively. The Allocated Monthly Flow Rates In The Three Dams Steering Program Are Not Sufficient To Preserve The Zab River Life. Iwa Publishing 2015.

Mean Values For Nei'S D Between A. Monica And A. Franciscana Were Very Low (0.09) And Consistent With Reported Cytological And Morphological Similarities, Thus The Physiological Differentiation Which Distinguishes The Former Must Involve Differences At Very Few Loci. D Values From A.

Article	Amirataee, B//Zeinalzadeh, K	Trends Analysis Of Quantitative And Qualitative Changes In Groundwater With Considering The Autocorrelation Coefficients In West Of Lake Urmia, Iran	Environmental Earth Sciences	Lake Urmia Is Known As One Of The Largest Saltwater Lakes On Earth. In The Past Decade, The Average Water Level Of This Lake Has Decreased Significantly And This Has Endangered Its Unique Ecosystem. As Such, The Water Level And Surrounding Groundwater Level Of Lake Urmia Are Related Together. Therefore, Investigating The Changes In The Quality And Quantity Of Groundwater Occupies A Very Important Status In Planning And Managing The Water Resources In The Region. Most Studies Conducted To Analyze Time Series Trends Have Made Use Of Common Non-Parametric Tests Of Mannkendall Or Spearmans Rho Tests, Which Do Not Pay Enough Attention To The Impact Of Autocorrelation On This Domain. Verily, Autocorrelation Coefficients May Leave Significant Impacts On The Trend Of Qualitative And Quantitative Changes In Groundwater Resources. Regarding The Present Study, Quantitative And Qualitative Parameters Of Groundwater Were Analyzed Using The Common And Modified Mannkendall Test With Considering The Impact Of Autocorrelation Coefficients. In Addition, The Values Of Trend Slope Were Estimated Using The Theilsen Estimator. The Results Indicated That Considering The Significant Autocorrelation Coefficients Was Essential In Assessing Time Series Trend. In Addition, Regarding The Modified Mannkendall Test As Well As The Analysis Of Temporal Changes In Qualitative Parameters Of Groundwater, It Was Indicated That Values Of Sodium Adsorption Ratio (Sar), Na And %Na Had Ascending Trends And The Other Values Had Decreasing Trends Thereof. Regarding The Spatial Trend, It Was Found That The Parameters Of Na, Ec, Ca, Mg, Anions And Cations Decreased Near Urmia City. 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

Many Approaches, Methods And Frameworks Have Been Presented To Define And Model This Issue. At Present Study, A Proposed Mathematical Equation Based On Gaussian Function Concept Is Introduced For Wrsd. Then, Amongst A Variety Of Water Resources Development Statuses, The Most Appropriate One Is Selected. Further, For Selected Status, Using Proposed Mathematical Function And System Dynamic Approach (Sda), Total Water Resources Development Curve Is Simulated. Finally, To Achieve Wrsd At The Ultimate Time, Sensitivity Analysis Is Evaluated. This Study Has Been Applied For Urmia Lake Main Basin In Iran. Results Show That Based On Total Water Development Function, The Ultimate Time Of Water Resources Development At Urmia Lake Basin Is Calculated 100 Years. Furthermore, Based On Proposed Water Development Equation, Drinking And Municipal Growth Rate Should Be Maintained 10% Constantly And Agricultural Growth Rate Should Decrease From 5% To 0.6%, However, The Industrial Growth Rate Should Rise From 10% To 18.8%.

Article	Badv, K//Deriszadeh, M	Wellhead Protection Area Delineation Using The Analytic Element Method	Water, Air, And Soil Pollution	Wellhead Protection Areas (Whpas) Were Delineated Around Three Water Supply Wells In Urmia Plain, Urmia City, Iran. Whaem2000 (V.2.1.0) Computer Model Based On The Analytic Element Method Was Used And Two Years Time Of Travel Whpas Were Delineated For Pumping Wells Drilled In The Basin Of Shahr-Chai River Located In Urmia Plain. The Steady-State Flow Was Applied For Unconfined Aquifer. This Feature Included The Main Surface Water Features (Rivers And Lake), Recharge Rate Due To Precipitation, Irrigation And Periodical Tributaries, And Inhomogeneity To Represent The Western Area Of The Plain, Having Different Characteristics. The Model Was Subsequently Calibrated By Means Of The Observed Piezometric Heads As Test Points. In Confined Aquifer The Groundwater Does Not Have Interaction With The Surface Waters And No Recharge Penetrates Into The Aquifer. Hence, Uniform Flow Was Applied To Create A New Model. In Confined Model Two Parameters (Hydraulic Gradient And Direction Of The Flow) Were Then Evaluated Using Three Points Method. To Overcome Uncertainties Related To The Aquifer Parameters And Lack Of Sufficient Piezometric Data, The Parameters Sensitivity Analysis And The Hypothesis Testing Method Were Used And The Final Whpas Were Reasonably Delineated For The Wells. Results Showed That The Shapes Of The Whpas For Wells In Unconfined Aquifer Are Longer And Narrower Than Those In Confined Aquifer. 2005 Springer.

Conference Paper	Bahadori, H//Hasheminezhad, A	Standard Penetration Test-Based Assessment Of Seismic Soil Liquefaction Potential Of Urmia, Iran	Proceedings Of The 5Th International Conference On Geotechnical And Geophysical Site Characterisation, Isc 2016	Soil Liquefaction Phenomenon Has Been Observed For Many Years, But Was Brought To The Attention Of Researches After Alaska And Niigata (Japan) Earthquakes In 1964. There Is No Direct Way To Measure The Liquefaction Potential In Soil, Yet. What Can Be Measured Directly Or Indirectly Are The Various Parameters That Control Soil'S Propensity To Liquefy On Seismic Loading. For This Purpose, Various Penetration Test Methods Such As Spt, Cpt And Dmt Are Examined. These Methods Are Completely Empirical In Nature And Have Worked Well To Date. Since Iran Is Located In An Area With High Seismic Probability, There Is A Need For The Liquefaction Potential Assessment In Coastal Areas Like Urmia Due To Its Proximity To Urmia Lake. In This Paper, With The Collected Borehole Data, An Attempt Was Made To Assess In Detail The Liquefaction Potential Of Urmia Soil Using Spt-Based Method. The Liquefaction Potential Was Expressed In Terms Of The Liquefaction Potential Index And Calculated Using Standard Penetration Test Profiles.

Four Populations Were Evaluated From Three Geographic Regions, Two Populations From The Urmia Lake Basin (One From The Mahabad Dam Lake And The Other From The Zarineh River), One Population From The Anzali Lagoon Basin And One Population From The Aras River Basin. Issr Primers Produced 99 Discernible Bands In The Four Populations. The Anzali Lagoon Population Showed Lower Level Of Diversity Than Other Populations. The Percentage Of Polymorphic Bands And Unbiased Expected Heterozygosity Were 98.99 And 0.342, Representing A Considerable Genetic Variation Through The Studied Populations. The Analysis Of Molecular Variance Results Showed Significant Variations Among Geographic Regions (P &Lt, 0.001). Comparison Of Pairwise Pt Values Revealed Significant Differences Between Geographic Regions, However, The Zarineh And The Mahabad Populations Within The Urmia Lake Basin Did Not Show Any Significant Difference (P &Lt, 0.05). The Northwest Iranian S. Glanis Populations Were Gathered Into Two Discrete Groups After Constructed Unrooted Neighbour-Joining Tree Based On Neis Unbiased Genetic Distance. One Group Formed By The Anzali Population And Other By The Mahabad, The Zarineh And The Aras Populations.

Article	Dalby, S//Moussavi, Z	Environmental Security, Geopolitics And The Case Of Lake Urmias Disappearance	Global Change, Peace And Security	Geopolitics, Climate Change And Environmental Security Operate In Complicated And Sometimes Directly Conflictual Ways. Driven In Part By National Policies Of Food Self-Sufficiency In Response To Economic Sanctions Imposed On Iran By American And European Policies, The Destruction Of One Of The Worlds Largest Inland Lakes Raises Questions About The Interaction Of Multiple Forms Of Security, And In Particular How Securitizations By Various Actors Interact At A Number Of Scales. Lake Urmia In North Western Iran Has Rapidly Dwindled In The Last Decade, A Result Of Unsustainable Water Extractions To Irrigate Growing Agricultural Production Of Apples And Other Horticultural Products. Clearly Assumptions That Security Is Additive Across Sectors And Scales Is Not The Case Here As Elsewhere, But The Urmia Lake Episode Emphasizes That They Are In Fact Frequently Operating At Cross-Purposes, National Security Strategies May Compromise Other Forms Of Security Quite Directly. Blaming Climate Change, And Possibly The Deliberate Use Of Climate Modification Techniques For The Lakes Demise Adds A Key Dimension To Securitization Discussions. This Matters For Security Studies More Generally Now Because Climate Change Is Increasingly Being Introduced As A Macrosecuritization In International Politics. 2016 Informa Uk Limited, Trading As Taylor & Francis Group.

Article	Danesh, Yazdi, M//Ataie, Ashtiani, B	Lake Urmia Crisis And Restoration Plan: Planning Without Appropriate Data And Model Is Gambling	Journal Of Hydrology	Losing Eight Meters Of Water Level Over A 20-Year Period From 1996 To 2016 Marked The Lake Urmia (Lu) As One Of The Regional Environmental Crises. This Condition Has Threatened Biota Life, Intensified Desertification Around The Lake, And Raised Social Concerns By Adversely Impacting The Inhabitants Health And Economy. In 2013, The Urmia Lake Restoration National Committee (Ulrnc) Started Implementing Certain Management Practices To Stop The Drying Trend Of Lu, Resulted In The Cease Of Water Level Drop And Stabilization Of Lu Condition In 2016. Nevertheless, The Restoration Actions Have Not Yet Raised The Lake To The Water Level As Planned By The Roadmap. This Paper Aims To Describe And To Assess The Lu Restoration Plans By Underscoring The Ulrnc Achievements, Challenges, And Shortcomings. In Particular, We Discuss How The Value Of Data And Data-Aided Modeling Has Been Underestimated By The Lu Restoration Programs, Leading To Still Existing Puzzles About The Lake Interaction With The Involving Physical Processes Governing Its Dynamics. We Show How The Lu Restoration Timetable Has Not Fulfilled The Planned Milestones As Evidenced By The Inability To Capture The Anticipated Lake Water Levels, Which Is Partly Attributed To The Lack Of Field Data And Dynamic Modeling That Could Predict The Lake Response In A More Reliable And Conservative Manner. The Current Restoration Plans Should Also Be Revisited To Ensure That Any Practice With The Aim Of Reducing Water Consumption In The Basin Is Not Only Environmentally Sustainable But Also Feasible From The Socioeconomic Perspective. The Insights Provided By This Paper Attempt To Underscore The Value Of Field Data Collection For Establishing A Reliable Conceptual Model, And For Executing Pre- And Post-Monitoring Of The Lake So That The Success Or Failure Of The Restoration Actions Taken By The Policymakers Can Be Appropriately Evaluated. 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Review	Eimanifar, A//Mohebbi, F	Urmia Lake (Northwest Iran): A Brief Review	Saline Systems	Lake Urmia (Or Ormiyeh) Is One Of The Largest Hypersaline Lakes In The World And The Habitat Of A Unique Bisexual Anemia Species (A Urmiana). Despite This, And Several Other Values Of The Lake, Little Literature On It Has Been Published. The Present Paper Is An Attempt To Provide A Brief Review On Various Aspects Of The Lake. Urmia Lake, Located In Northwestern Iran, Is An Oligotrophic Lake Of Thalassohaline Origin With A Total Surface Area Between 4750 And 6100 Km 2 And A Maximum Depth Of 16 M At An Altitude Of 1250 M. The Lake Is Divided Into North And South Parts Separated By A Causeway In Which A 1500-M Gap Provides Little Exchange Of Water Between The Two Parts. Due To Drought And Increased Demands For Agricultural Water In The Lake'S Basin, The Salinity Of The Lake Has Risen To More Than 300 G/L During Recent Years, And Large Areas Of The Lake Bed Have Been Desiccated. Therefore, Management And Conservation Of This Incomparable Ecosystem Should Be Considered To Improve The Current Condition By Fisheries Research Institutes.

According To Sequence Data, A. Urmiana Exhibits A High Level Of Haplotype Diversity With A Low Level Of Nucleotide Diversity. The Haplotype Spanning Network Recognized 36 Closely Related Unique Haplotypes. Issr Profiles Confirmed A Substantial Amount Of Genomic Diversity With A Low Level Of Population Structure. No Apparent Genetic Structure Was Recognized In Lake Urmia But Rather A Random Geographic Distribution Of Genotypes Indicating A High Degree Of Panmixia. The Population Genetic Data Indicate The Possibility Of An Individual'S Relationship, Implying That Differentiation Of Individuals Is Not Affected By Ecological Factors. Therefore, The A.

Article	Emami, F//Koch, M	Evaluation Of Statistical-Downscaling/Bias-Correction Methods To Predict Hydrologic Responses To Climate Change In The Zarrine River Basin, Iran	Climate	Modeling The Hydrologic Responses To Future Changes Of Climate Is Important For Improving Adaptive Water Management. In The Present Application To The Zarrine River Basin (Zrb), With The Major Reach Being The Main Inflow Source Of Lake Urmia (Lu), Firstly Future Daily Temperatures And Precipitation Are Predicted Using Two Statistical Downscaling Methods: The Classical Statistical Downscaling Model (Sdsm), Augmented By A Trend-Preserving Bias Correction, And A Two-Step Updated Quantile Mapping (Qm) Method. The General Circulation Models (Gcm) Input To Sdsm Are Climate Predictors Of The Canadian Earth System Model (Canesm2) Gcm Under The Representative Concentration Pathway (Rcp) Emission Scenarios, Rcp45 And Rcp85, Whereas That To The Qm Is Provided By The Most Suitable Of Several Climate Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (Cmip5) Gcms Under Rcp60, In Addition. The Performances Of The Two Downscaling Methods Are Compared To Each Other For A Past Future Period (2006-2016) And The Qm Is Found To Be Better And So Is Selected In The Subsequent Zr Streamflow Simulations By Means Of The Soil And Water Assessment Tool (Swat) Hydrological Model, Calibrated And Validated For The Reference Period (1991-2012). The Impacts Of Climate Change On The Hydrologic Response Of The River Basin, Specifically The Inflow To The Boukan Reservoir, The Reservoir-Dependable Water Release (Dwr), Are Then Compared For The Three Rcps In The Near- (2020-2038), Middle- (2050-2068) And Far- (2080-2098) Future Periods Assuming (1) The Current Consumptive Demand To Be Continued In The Future, And (2) A More Conservative Recommended Demand. A Systematic Future Shortage Of The Available Water Is Obtained For Case (1) Which Can Be Mitigated Somewhat For (2). Finally, The Swat-Predicted Zrb Outflow Is Compared With The Montana-Based Estimated Environmental Flow Of The Zr. The Latter Can Successfully Be Sustained At Good And Fair Levels For The Near- And Middle-Future Periods, But Not So For The Summer Months Of The Far-Future Period, Particularly, For Rcp85. 2018 By The Authors.

Article	Emami, F//Koch, M	Modeling The Impact Of Climate Change On Water Availability In The Zarrine River Basin And Inflow To The Boukan Dam, Iran	Climate	The Impacts Of Climate Change On The Water Availability Of Zarrine River Basin (Zrb), The Headwater Of Lake Urmia, In Western Iran, With The Boukan Dam, Are Simulated Under Various Climate Scenarios Up To Year 2029, Using The Swat Hydrological Model. The Latter Is Driven By Meteorological Variables Predicted From Mpi-Esm-Lr-Gcm (Precipitation) And Canesm2-Gcm (Temperature)Gcmmodels With Rcp 2.6, Rcp 4.5 And Rcp 8.5 Climate Scenarios, And Downscaled With Quantile Mapping (Qm) Bias-Correction And Sdsm, Respectively. From Two Variants Of Qm Employed, The Empirical-Cdf-Qm Model Decreased The Biases Of Raw Gcm- Precipitation Predictors Particularly Strongly. Swat Was Then Calibrated And Validated With Historical (1981-2011) Zr-Streamflow, Using The Swat-Cup Model. The Subsequent Swat-Simulations For The Future Period 2012-2029 Indicate That The Predicted Climate Change For All Rcps Will Lead To A Reduction Of The Inflow To Boukan Dam As Well As Of The Overall Water Yield Of Zrb, Mainly Due To A 23-35% Future Precipitation Reduction, With A Concomitant Reduction Of The Groundwater Baseflow To The Main Channel. Nevertheless, The Future Runoff-Coefficient Shows A 3%, 2% And 1% Increase, As The -2% To -26% Decrease Of The Surface Runoff Is Overcompensated By The Named Precipitation Decrease. In Summary, Based On These Predictions, Together With The Expecting Increase Of Demands Due To The Agricultural And Other Developments, The Zrb Is Likely To Face A Water Shortage In The Near Future As The Water Yield Will Decrease By -17% To -39%, Unless Some Adaptation Plans Are Implemented For A Better Management Of Water Resources. 2019 By The Authors.

Article	Emami, F//Koch, M	Sustainability Assessment Of Thewater Management System For The Boukan Dam, Iran, Using Cordex- South Asia Climate Projections	Water (Switzerland)	The Present Study Aimed To Quantify The Future Sustainability Of A Water Supply System Using Dynamically-Downscaled Regional Climate Models (Rcms), Produced In The South Asia Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (Cordex) Framework. The Case Study Is The Boukan Dam, Located On The Zarrine River (Zr) Of Urmia'S Drying Lake Basin, Iran. Different Cordex- Models Were Evaluated For Model Performance In Predicting The Temperatures And Precipitation In The Zr Basin (Zrb). The Climate Output Of The Most Suitable Climate Model Under The Rcp45 And Rcp85 Scenarios Was Then Bias-Corrected For Three 19-Year-Long Future Periods (2030, 2050, And 2080), And Employed As Input To The Soil And Water Assessment Tool (Swat) River Basin Hydrologic Model To Simulate Future Boukan Reservoir Inflows. Subsequently, The Reservoir Operation/Water Demands In The Zrb Were Modeled Using The Modsim Water Management Tool For Two Water Demand Scenarios, I.E., Wd Current And Wd Recom , Which Represent The Current And The More Sustainable Water Demand Scenarios, Respectively. The Reliability Of The Dam'S Water Supply For Different Water Uses In The Study Area Was Then Investigated By Computing The Supply/Demand Ratio (Sdr). The Results Showed That, Although The Sdrs For The Wd Recom Were Generally Higher Than That Of The Wd Current , The Sdrs Were All &Lt, 1, I.E., Future Water Deficits Still Prevailed. Finally, The Performance Of The Water Supply System Was Evaluated By Means Of Risk, Reliability, Resiliency, Vulnerability, And Maximum Deficit Indices, And The Combination Of The Indices To Estimate The Sustainability Group Index (Sgi). The Findings Indicated That, Compared To The Historical Period For Both The Water Demand Scenarios, Wd Current And Wd Recom , The Average Sgi Of Each Rcp Would Be Decreased Significantly, Particularly, For The More Extreme Rcp85 Scenario. However, As Expected, The Sgi Decrease For The Wd Recom Was Less Than That Of The Wd Current , Indicating The Advantage Of Implementing This More Sustainable Water Demand Scenario. 2018 By The Authors.

For This Purpose, A Model Based On Discrete Wavelet Transform, Arimax And Least Squares Support Vector Machine (Lssvm) (W-S-Lssvm) Was Developed. The Proposed Model Was Designed To Handle Linear, Nonlinear And Seasonality Of Rainfall Time Series. In The Proposed Model, Time Series Were Decomposed Into Sub-Series (Approximation (A) And Details (D)). Next, The Sub-Series Were Predicted Separately. In The Proposed Model, Sub-Series Were Fed Into Sarimax To Be Predicted. The Residual Of Predicted Sub-Series (Error) Of The Rainfall Time Series Was Then Fed Into Lssvm To Predict The Residual Components. Then, All Predicted Values Were Aggregated To Rebuild The Predicted Time Series. In Order To Compare Results, First A Classic Modeling Was Performed By Lssvm. Later, Wavelet-Based Lssvm Was Used To Capture The Peak Values Of Rainfall. Results Revealed That Daubechies 4 And Decomposition Level 4 (Db(4,4)) Led To The Best Outcome. Due To The Performance Of Db(4,4), It Was Selected To Be Applied In The Proposed Model. Based On Results, It Was Observed That The W-S-Lssvms Performance Was Improved In Comparison With Other Models.

Article	Fathian, F//Dehghan, Z	Using Hybrid Weighting-Clustering Approach For Regional Frequency Analysis Of Maximum 24-Hr Rainfall Based On Climatic, Geographical, And Statistical Attributes	International Journal Of Climatology	Estimation Of Extreme Rainfall Amounts Has Great Importance, Especially In Some Fields Such As The Design Of Water Structures, Water Resources Engineering, Extreme Flood Management, And Soil Erosion Conservation. One Of The Problems, Which Hydrologists Faced, Is An Acceptable Estimation Of Extreme Events In Areas With Insufficient Data. In This Case, Separation Of The Study Area Into Homogenous Regions And Performing Regional Frequency Analysis (Rfa) Result In Greater Precision And Fewer Errors In Frequency Analysis Models, Enabling Estimation Of Quantiles For Each Return Period In The Region Of Interest. In This Study, The Maximum 24-Hr Rainfall Data Related To Lake Urmia Basin (Lub) For 63 Selected Stations During The Period Of 19792008 Are Used. Moreover, Determining An Appropriate Weight For Each Group Of Attributes Is Attempted According To The Degree Of Importance And Contribution Share Of Each Climatic, Geographical, And Statistical Attribute. Then, For Regionalization Using A Clustering Approach, The Attributes Are Defined In Seven Different Groups. Subsequently, The Performance Of Different Groups Associated With Weighted Attributes Of Maximum 24-Hr Rainfall Is Evaluated For Rfa In The Study Area. The Results Showed That The Combination Of Climatic, Geographical, And Statistical Attributes Present Better Results And More Reliable Estimates Of Extreme Values. The Results Indicated Better Performance Of Weighted Models To The Attributes Compared To Non-Weighted Frequency Analysis Models In The Estimation Of Maximum 24-Hr Rainfall. The Results Also Showed That By Evaluating Three To Four Groups And Applying Average Weights Of 0.30.85 For The Attributes Through The Use Of Hybrid Weighting-Clustering Approach, More Accurate Estimates Of Extreme Values For Different Return Periods Can Be Obtained. 2019 Royal Meteorological Society	Attributes, Lake Urmia Basin, Maximum 24-Hr Rainfall, Regional Frequency Analysis, Weighting-Clustering Approach, Flood Control, Image Segmentation, Lakes, Rain, Soil Conservation, Water Conservation, Attributes, Clustering Approach, Frequency Analysis, Lake Urmia, Region Of Interest, Regional Frequency Analysis, Reliable Estimates, Weighted Attributes, Frequency Estimation	10.1002/JOC.6082	NA	Scopus	NA	2019

Article	Feizizadeh, B//Blaschke, T	An Uncertainty And Sensitivity Analysis Approach For Gis-Based Multicriteria Landslide Susceptibility Mapping	International Journal Of Geographical Information Science	Gis-Based Multicriteria Decision Analysis (Mcda) Methods Are Increasingly Being Used In Landslide Susceptibility Mapping. However, The Uncertainties That Are Associated With Mcda Techniques May Significantly Impact The Results. This May Sometimes Lead To Inaccurate Outcomes And Undesirable Consequences. This Article Introduces A New Gis-Based Mcda Approach. We Illustrate The Consequences Of Applying Different Mcda Methods Within A Decision-Making Process Through Uncertainty Analysis. Three Gis-Mcda Methods In Conjunction With Monte Carlo Simulation (Mcs) And Dempster-Shafer Theory Are Analyzed For Landslide Susceptibility Mapping (Lsm) In The Urmia Lake Basin In Iran, Which Is Highly Susceptible To Landslide Hazards. The Methodology Comprises Three Stages. First, The Lsm Criteria Are Ranked And A Sensitivity Analysis Is Implemented To Simulate Error Propagation Based On The Mcs. The Resulting Weights Are Expressed Through Probability Density Functions. Accordingly, Within The Second Stage, Three Mcda Methods, Namely Analytical Hierarchy Process (Ahp), Weighted Linear Combination (Wlc) And Ordered Weighted Average (Owa), Are Used To Produce The Landslide Susceptibility Maps. In The Third Stage, Accuracy Assessments Are Carried Out And The Uncertainties Of The Different Results Are Measured. We Compare The Accuracies Of The Three Mcda Methods Based On (1) The Dempster-Shafer Theory And (2) A Validation Of The Results Using An Inventory Of Known Landslides And Their Respective Coverage Based On Object-Based Image Analysis Of Irs-Id Satellite Images. The Results Of This Study Reveal That Through The Integration Of Gis And Mcda Models, It Is Possible To Identify Strategies For Choosing An Appropriate Method For Lsm. Furthermore, Our Findings Indicate That The Integration Of Mcda And Mcs Can Significantly Improve The Accuracy Of The Results. In Lsm, The Ahp Method Performed Best, While The Owa Reveals Better Performance In The Reliability Assessment. The Wlc Operation Yielded Poor Results. 2014 The Author(S).

The Objective Of The Research Is To Investigate The Differences Of Precipitation And River Discharge Before And After Initiation Of The Construction Of The Bridge In 2000. The Study Area Was The Watershed Of The Lake. The Averages Of The Precipitation Data In The Two Periods Before And After The Project Have Been Interpolated By Idw Based On Gis Geostatistical Analyst. The Two Interpolated Precipitation Layers Were Used To Be Plugged Into Student T-Test Equation In Gis In A Spatial Basis. To Do This, The Study Area Was Divided To 25 Regions Based On Drainage Sub-Basins. Less Than 30 Sample Areas Were Randomly Selected As Cases From Each Of The Regions To Put Into The Equation. The Discharge Data Were Also Compared For The Two Periods. The Results Indicated That Except In Some Limited Areas, The Precipitation Differences In The Two Periods Are Significant. This Means That There Were Little Changes In Precipitation And River Discharge In The Area And Consequently The Drying May Be Caused Mainly By Hydrodynamic Changes In The Lake Due To Construction Of The Causeway. However, It Can Be Argued That The Changes In The Lake'S Surface Area Are Accompanied By Changes In Precipitation And River Discharge. The T Test Statistic Can Be Applied Samples Based On Spatial Analysis.

Article	Ghashghaie, M//Nozari, H	Effect Of Dam Construction On Lake Urmia: Time Series Analysis Of Water Level Via Arima	Journal Of Agricultural Science And Technology	Lake Urmia Is One Of The Water Bodies That Face Severe Drought Conditions Nowadays. Therefore, The Present Study Aimed To Study Monthly Time Series Of The Lake Water Level. Modeling The Series Was Accomplished In Two Ways. First, All Data Were Used To Analyze The Water Level Time Series Of The Lake. Although The Results Of Generating Were Quite Well, The Results Of Validity Test Were Not Satisfying. Second, Only Water Level Data After The Year 1995 Were Used, Which Showed A Continuously Decreasing Trend. These Data Start From The Year When Dam Constructions And Operations In Urmia Watershed Were Increased One By One. The Values Of R2 And Rmse Were 0.99, 0.001 M, Respectively, For Generating The Data At This Stage. These Values Were 0.93 And 0.03 M For The Validity Test Of The Model (From 2005 To 2009). The Results Of Our Study Show That The Lake Water Level Behavior Changed After 1995 Due To Constructing Many Dams In Urmia Lake Watershed. 2018, Tarbiat Modares University. All Rights Reserved.

Conference Paper	Ghomashi, F//Khalesifard, Hr	Calipso Recordings And Categorization Of Atmospheric Aerosols Over The Urmia Lake	E3S Web Of Conferences	The Urmia Lake Is Suffering From A Severe Drought Scenario That Started In Recent Decades. The Lake Has Lost Almost 88% Of Its Surface Area In Comparison To Its Value In 1995. This Has Left A Bed Of Salt Around The Lake, That Has The Potential To Disperse A Significant Amount Of Aerosols (Dust And Salt) Into The Atmosphere. We Use The Recordings Of The Calipso Satellite To Investigate The Optical Parameters Of Atmospheric Aerosols Over The Urmia Lake. For This Purpose, The Aerosol Optical Depth (Aod) And The Particulate Depolarization Ratio (Pdr) At 532 Nm Have Been Selected From The Whole Available Recordings Of The Calipso. To Distinguish Between The Atmospheric Particles Which Are Originating From The Lake Bed And Those That Are Transported From The Surrounding Sources To The Lake Area, The Pdr Has Been Categorized For Two Altitude Ranges, I.E., From The Ground Level Up To 2 Km Above The Mean Sea Level (Amsl) And Above 3 Km Amsl. Investigating The Variations Of The Pdr At These Two Altitude Ranges, Provides Information About The Type Of Atmospheric Particles At Different Times Of The Year. Although It Is Not Easy To Distinguish Between The Transported Dust Layers And Atmospheric Particles From The Lake Bed, It Seems That The Urmia Lake Is Mostly Active In The Driest Times Of The Year, I.E., June To October. Also, It Seems That The Particles Which Are Originating From The Lake, Are Mostly Dry Salt Particles, Where Their Corresponding Pdr Is 0.16 0.05. 2019 The Authors, Published By Edp Sciences.

Article	Gorgij, Ad//Moghaddam, Aa	Vulnerability Assessment Of Saltwater Intrusion Using Simplified Gapdit Method: A Case Study Of Azarshahr Plain Aquifer, East Azerbaijan, Iran	Arabian Journal Of Geosciences	The Index-Based Method (Galdit) Has Been Established Over The Years For Assessing The Vulnerability Of Aquifers For Saline Water Intrusion Based On Six Parameters, I.E., Groundwater Occurrence, Aquifer Hydraulic Conductivity, Level Of Water Table Above The Sea, Distance From Shore, Impact Of Existing Amplitude Of Saline Water Intrusion, And Thickness Of The Aquifer. This Method Incorporates Weight And The Importance Rating Of Factors To Assess The Vulnerable Zones To Saltwater. The Objective Of The Present Investigation Is To Simplify The Galdit Method As A Procedure In Vulnerability Assessment Of Saltwater Intrusion By Substituting For The Level Of The Water Table Above The Sea With The More Effective Groundwater Pumping Rate In Order To Effectively Represent The Groundwater Condition. Hence, The Method Is Named As The Gapdit Method (L Being Replaced By P). The Developed Model Was Applied To A Coastal Aquifer In The Hyper-Saline Lake Vicinity Of Urmia, Iran. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (Ahp) Was Employed To Enhance The Prediction Of Vulnerability Distribution. Thus, For Every Factor, A Separate Interpolated Layer Was Plotted By Empirical Bayesian Kriging (Ebk) Method, And Then, A Final Vulnerability Map Was Derived Overlaying The Individual Layers And Their Special Weight Application. The Outcome Revealed That The Substituted Pumping Rate Was Justified In Cases That Water Table Data Are Not Available And Resultant Maps Showed Reasonable Correlation Between The Galdit And Gapdit Methods. Also, The Derived Maps Revealed That The Highest Vulnerability Exists In The Northwest Of The Study Area. 2016, Saudi Society For Geosciences.

Article	Hamzehpour, N//Bogaert, P	Improved Spatiotemporal Monitoring Of Soil Salinity Using Filtered Kriging With Measurement Errors: An Application To The West Urmia Lake, Iran	Geoderma	Real-Time Monitoring Of Soil Salinity Based On Field Samples And Laboratory Analyses Is A Costly And Time Demanding Procedure, So That Sound Methods That Could Reduce The Burden By Making Use Of Cheaper Data Would Be A Step Toward A More Sustainable Salinity Hazards Monitoring System On The Long Run. Typically, This Involves Replacing Presumably Error-Free Laboratory Salinity Measurements With Indirect Measurements That Are However Affected By Various Source Of Uncertainties, And These Uncertainties Need To Be Accounted For In Order To Avoid Compromising The Quality Of The Final Results. More Specifically, In A Spatiotemporal Prediction Framework Where Salinity Maps Need To Be Drawn Repeatedly At Various Time Instants And Where Salinity Values Need To Be Compared Over Time For Agricultural Areas That Are Prone To Salinity Hazards, It Is Of Major Importance To Process These Uncertainties In A Sound Way, As Failing To Do So Would Impair Our Ability To Detect Salinity Changes At An Early Stage For Taking Preventive Actions. The Aim Of This Paper Is To Propose A Filtered Kriging Framework That Allows The User To Rely On Cheap Field Sampled Electrical Conductivity (Ec) Measurements, That Cannot However Be Assumed As Error-Free. Field Ec Measurements Need To Be Calibrated From Laboratory Measurements And The Corresponding Calibration Errors Cannot Be Neglected. Moreover, When Sampling Is Repeated Over Time, Positioning Errors Are Quite Common And Can Adversely Impact The Results Due To The Inclusion Of An Extra Variability Source. It Is Shown How These Uncertainties Can Be Quantified And Successfully Processed Afterwards For Improving Both The Reliability Of The Spatial Predictions And Temporal Comparisons Of Soil Salinity. The Idea Is To Rely On A Same General Optimal Linear Predictor That Can Be Easily Adapted To Get Rid Of These Unwanted Effects. The Procedure Is Illustrated By Using A Rich Data Set Of Ec Measurements That Cover A Time Span Of Seven Years In The Western Part Of Urmia Lake, Northwest Iran. From These Data, It Is Shown How Calibration Errors Can Be Considered As Spatially Independent And Zero-Mean Gaussian Distributed, While Laboratory Measurements Exhibit A Clear Spatial Structure But Are Also Affected By A Not Inconsiderable Spatial Nugget Effect, Which Is In Turn Impacting The Errors For Field Ec Measurements Due To The Positioning Errors. By Relying On A Linear Optimal Predictor That Reduces Here To Filtered Kriging With Measurement Errors, It Is Shown That Filtering Out These Two Random Effect Components Clearly Improves The Quality Of The Results When It Comes To Map Ec Values And To Detect Changes That Occurred Over Time. Comparing Filtered Values For The Successive Sampling Campaigns Provided Evidence That A Major Salinity Shift Did Occur Between Autumn 2011 And Autumn 2014 While The Other Parts Of The Area Were Left Unchanged By Comparison. From This Study, It Can Be Concluded That Even If The Only Errors Involved In This Work Were Linked To Calibration And Positioning Errors, The Methodology Is General Enough To Process Various Sources Of Uncertainties In General. It Is Thus A Valuable Tool For Practitioners, With A Field Of Potential Applications That Goes Beyond The Framework Of Salinity Monitoring. 2017	Electrical Conductivity, Filtered Kriging, Measurement Errors, Soil Salinity, Spatial Prediction, Urmia Lake, Calibration, Electric Conductivity, Electric Conductivity Measurement, Errors, Forecasting, Hazards, Interpolation, Laboratories, Lakes, Measurement Errors, Random Errors, Random Processes, Research Laboratories, Salinity Measurement, Soils, Uncertainty Analysis, Electrical Conductivity, Indirect Measurements, Kriging, Laboratory Measurements, Soil Salinity, Sources Of Uncertainty, Spatial Prediction, Spatio-Temporal Prediction, Soil Surveys, Calibration, Data Set, Electrical Conductivity, Error Analysis, Gaussian Method, Kriging, Laboratory Method, Monitoring System, Salinity, Spatiotemporal Analysis, Uncertainty Analysis, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1016/J.GEODERMA.2017.02.004	22-33	Scopus	295	2017
Article	Hamzehpour, N//Eghbal, Mk	Spatiotemporal Prediction Of Soil Salinity Boundary Using Kriging With Measurment Errors	Ecology, Environment And Conservation	Soil Salinity And Its Mapping Are Of Great Importance In Arid And Semiarid Regions, Especially Where Continued Monitoring Of Soil Salinity Changes Is Prove Expensive. The Aim Of The Present Paper Was To Compare Measured Error Resulted From Calibration Equations In Different Sampling Campaigns And Their Use In Soil Salinity Prediction With Soft Data In Several Time Instants. Study Area Was Located In Western Part Of Urmia Lake, Northwest Iran. Soil Samples Were Taken From 0-20 Cm During Seven Sampling Campaigns Between 2009-2015. Samplings Were Done On A Grid Of 500 Meters For The First Sampling Campaigns And 250 Meters And Less For Other Time Intervals. Soil Electrical Conductivity Was Measured In The Field For All Times Series And In The Laboratory, Only For First, Second And Fifth Data Sets. After Calibrating Field Ec By Laboratory Ec, Soil Salinity Histograms Of Residuals Were Calculated By Observed Lab Data Minus Estimated Ones For The First And Second Datasets. Then Probability Density Functions Were Calculated And Used In Soil Salinity Prediction Using Kriging With Measurement Errors For The Third Dataset. After Validation Of The Predicted Values For The Third Dataset, The Same Error And Developed Model Were Used In Soil Salinity Prediction In Other Four Time Instants. Me And Mse Were Calculated As Quantitative Criteria For Assessing The Accuracy Of Predictions. Results From Error Calculation And Its Use In Prediction Showed That There Were No Significant Differences Among Predicted Values Using Measured Error From The First And Second Data Sets And Also Combination Of Both. Validation Of The Produced Salinity Maps Of The Study Area Revealed That Application Of The General Prediction Model Developed For The Study Area And Calculated Error For Spring 2010 (Second Dataset) Could Successfully Predict Soil Salinity During Other Time Intervals With Me And Mse Equal To -0.12 And 0.92 For Autumn 2014. The Reduced Need For Constant Calibration Of Field Measured Data And Number Of Soil Samples During Several Sampling Campaigns Will Reduce Soil Salinity Monitoring Costs In Saline Areas Like Urmia Lake Margins, Where There Is A Great Need For Careful Monitoring.

Changes In Irrigated Land And Agricultural Water Use In The Lake Urmia Basin. Lake Reserv Manage. 32:288296. In The Urmia Basin, Intensive Agriculture Relies Heavily On Irrigation Systems Using River-Fed Irrigation Canals And Groundwater-Supplied Pressure Systems, Causing Lake Urmia To Shrink In Recent Years. The Loss Of Lake Area Has Diminished The Productivity Of Surrounding Agricultural Lands And Caused Environmental Out-Migration And Substantial Economic Losses. Because Water Resources In The Lake Urmia Basin Are Limited, The Government Has Prohibited New Development Plans And Determination Of New Water Rights. In This Study, Remote Sensing, Geographic Information Systems, And Data Gathered From Official Organizations Were Used To Quantify The Change In Area Under Irrigation And Water Consumption. Multi-Date Landsat Thematic Mapper Imagery Was Employed To Derive The Land Use Map. The Study Was Conducted In The Miandoab Alluvial Plain, A 1025 Km2 Area In The Southeast Part Of The Lake Urmia Basin, Locatedin Northwest Iran. Crop Data Gathered From Fieldobservations Were Used To Verify The Land Cover Map. To Quantify The Change In Agricultural Water Use, The Net Irrigation Water Requirements For Each Crop Were Determined Using The Cropwat Model, And The Reference Evapotranspiration Was Estimated Using The Penmanmonteith Equation. The Results Of This Study Indicated A 19,363Ha Increase In Total Irrigated Area (20%) And A 226 Million Cubic Meter Increase In Water Demand (35%) For Irrigation During The Study Period.

Formulation Of Stationary Random Field Theory Has Been Modified And Adapted To Non-Stationary State In Order To Take Into Account The Mean And Variance Variability For Soil Properties. Multi-Variance Correlation Matrix Along With The Cholesky Decomposition Technique Was Employed To Produce Realisations Of Non-Homogenous And Non-Stationary Random Fields Of Cpt Profiles. A Piecewise And Segmental Data Realisation According To The Lithology And Site Class Specifications Acquired Directly From Cpt Data Is Adopted In This Study So As To Render An Accurate Data Simulation. For Validation Of Proposed Method 8 Cpt Test Profiles Collected From Urmia Lake Site Have Been Introduced And Simulated By The Stationary And Non-Stationary Algorithms. The Mean Correlation Coefficient Between The Actual Cpt Data Profiles And Related Realisations Along With Some Other Important Statistical Parameters And Their Coefficients Of Variation Strongly Demonstrate That Non-Stationary Random Field Generation Technique Gives Quite Better Accuracy, By Comparison To The Conventional Stationary Random Field Generation Scheme. 2015 Taylor & Francis.

In This Study, Five Absolute Homogeneity Tests And One Clustering Approach Were Used To Determine The Homogeneity Status Of The Streamflow Time Series (Over The Period 19602010) In 14 Hydrometric Stations Of Three Important Basins (I.E., Aras River Basin, Urmia Lake Basin And Sefid-Roud Basin) In Northwestern Iran. Results Of The Buishand Range Test, Von Neumann Ratio Test, Cumulative Deviation Test, Standard Normal Homogeneity Test And Pettitt Test For Monthly Streamflow Time Series Detected That About 42.26%, 38.09%, 33.33%, 39.28% And 68.45% Of The Streamflow Time Series Were Inhomogeneous At The 0.01 Significance Level, Respectively. Streamflow Time Series Of The Stations Located In The Eastern Parts Of The Study Area Or Within The Urmia Lake Basin Were Mostly Homogeneous. In Contrast, Streamflow Time Series In The Stations Of The Aras River Basin And Sefied-Roud Basin Showed Inhomogeneity At Annual Scales. Based On The Overall Classification For The Monthly And Annual Streamflow Series, We Determined That About 45.60%, 11.53% And 42.85% Of The Time Series Were Categorized Into The Useful, Doubtful And Suspect Classes According To The Five Absolute Homogeneity Tests. We Also Found The Homogeneity Patterns Of The Streamflow Time Series By Using The Clustering Approach. The Results Suggested The Effectiveness Of The Clustering Approach For Homogeneity Analysis Of The Streamflow Time Series In Addition To The Absolute Homogeneity Tests. Moreover, Results Of The Absolute Homogeneity Tests And Clustering Approach Indicated Obvious Decreasing Change Points Of The Streamflow Time Series In The 1990S Over The Three Basins, Which Were Mostly Related To The Hydrological Droughts. 2018, Xinjiang Institute Of Ecology And Geography, The Chinese Academy Of Sciences And Springer-Verlag Gmbh Germany, Part Of Springer Nature.

Lake Urmia Resembles The Great Salt Lake, U.S.A. In Many Respects Of Morphology, Water Chemistry, And Sediments. The Present Lake Area Is About 5000 Km 2 , Shallow (8-12 M), And A Perennial Sodium Chloride-Sulfate System (22% Salts). High Resolution (3.5 Khz) Seismic Profiles Show Morphological Relicts From A Desiccation Playa Phase Buried Below Only A Few Meters Of Sediments From Lacustral Phases. In Places, Around The Deeper Areas, The Lake Floor Is Not Smooth But Covered With Mounds Aligned In Prevailing Current Directions. These Are Erosional Relicts Rather Than Bioherms. Sediments Comprise Aragonite Chemical Precipitates, Fecal-Pellet Sands, Detrital Clayey Muds, Thin Aragonite Crusts, Oolites, Various Gypsum Types And Occurrences Of Dolomite In Peripheral Areas. Organic Matter, Characteristic Of The Present Shorelines, Is Not Preserved At Depth In Basinal Areas. Piston Cores Up To 6 M Long Penetrated A Holocene Sequence Of Hypersaline Facies With Laminated Aragonite-Fecal-Pellet Muds And Bottomed In A Playa-Mudflat Facies With Central Gypsiferous Muds And Marginal Terrigenous To Dolomitic Muds. Preliminary Radiocarbon And Pollen Analyses Suggest A Playa Stage Prior To 9000 Yr B.P. With Saline Lake Deposition In A Cool Arid Climate. From 9000 To 7500 Yr B.P., Higher-Energy Facies Prevailed In A Shallow Saline Lake And, Since Then, Present-Day Saline Environments Have Persisted With Evidence Of Numerous Second-Order Water-Level Fluctuations.

Article	Khodaei, K//Nassery, Hr	Groundwater Exploration Using Remote Sensing And Geographic Information Systems In A Semi-Arid Area (Southwest Of Urmieh, Northwest Of Iran)	Arabian Journal Of Geosciences	Shortage Of Water Required For Drinking And Agricultural Uses Is A Subject With A Vital Importance In Most Arid And Semi-Arid Regions. The Area Of This Study Is One Of The Semi-Arid Regions Located In Southwest Of Urmieh Lake, Northwest Of Iran, Between N 3700, 3715 Latitude And E 4505, 4530 Longitude Which Is Composed Of Permian Dolomitic Limestone, Limestone, And Post-Jurassic Granite With A Very Low Primary Porosity/Permeability Character. In Order To Delineate Groundwater Potential Zones In This Area, The Study Focused On Identifying Secondary Porosity/Permeability Indicators Such As Lineaments, Vegetation Cover, Lithology, Drainage Pattern, Drainage Density, Etc. In This Regard, A Remote Sensing And Geographic Information System-Based Methodology Was Selected. Landsat Etm, Irs (Pan), Spot Data, Digital Elevation Model, And Digital Image Processing Techniques Such As Filtering, False Color Composite, Principal Component Analysis, Band Rationing And Classification Have Been Applied To Reach The Purposes. Information Layers Extracted For Analysis And Interpretation Stage Were Then Integrated With Other Data And Modeled Through The Use Of Existing Geographic Information System (Gis) Software And Their Related Analytical Functions. Finally, Based On Determined Ground Water Favorability Index For Different Sub Zones, Layers, Weighting, And Overlapping, A Ground Water Potential Index (Gwpi) Was Defined Which Respectively Was Utilized To Groundwater Potential Zoning And Preparation Of Gwpi Map Of The Region. Within The Six Different Sub Zones Defined, Two Sub Zones Labeled With High And Very Good Potential Areas Were Highly Recommended For Further Development And Exploration Purposes. Geophysical Investigations In Target Areas Confirm The Labeled Subzones. Based On The Obtained Results Of The Study, It Can Be Concluded That Remote Sensing Data Are Very Useful Tool To Extract Information Of Groundwater Exploration. Also, Application Of Geographic Information Systems To Find Target Areas For Groundwater Exploration Are Effective To Save Time And Cost. 2011 Saudi Society For Geosciences.

Article	Kokya, Ba//Kokya, Ta	Proposing A Formula For Evaporation Measurement From Salt Water Resources	Hydrological Processes	Evaporation Involves The Change In State Of A Liquid To A Vapour. The Evaporation Rate From Salt-Water Resources Depends Mostly On Saturated Vapour Pressure Above Its Surface. On The Other Hand, The Saturated Vapour Pressure Is Affected By The Ion Activity Coefficient, Which Stems From The Chemical Salt Concentration Of Water. Thus, An Increase In Concentration Of Water Results In A Reduction Of Saturated Vapour Pressure. In Order To Acquire The Actual Rate Of Evaporation From Salt-Water Resources, A Uniform Set Of Evaporation Pans With Different But Specified Salt Concentrations Were Used, In A Meteorological Station Under The Same Conditions. The Difference In Evaporation Rate Of Each Pan Can Only Stem From The Difference In Chemical Salt Concentration And, Indeed, The Molar Fraction Of Water In Each Saline Solution. Therefore, By Applying The Water Molar Fraction In The Pressure Term Of Fresh-Water Evaporation Measurement Formulas, These Equations Were Developed Further For Determination Of Evaporation Rate From Salt-Water Resources. The Proposed Formulas Using Very Simple Terms Seem To Be Suitable For Determination Of Evaporation Rate From Any Water (Typically Saline, Semi-Saline And Fresh Water) With A Satisfactory Precision.

Article	Malekian, A//Kazemzadeh, M	Spatio-Temporal Analysis Of Regional Trends And Shift Changes Of Autocorrelated Temperature Series In Urmia Lake Basin	Water Resources Management	Recently, The Urmia Lake Located In Northwestern Iran Which Is The Second Largest Hyper Saline In The World Suffers From The Significant Fluctuations Of Water Level And Surface Area. The Current Study Tries To Investigate The Spatiotemporal Trends Of Mean (Tmean), Maximum (Tmax) And Minimum (Tmin) Temperatures Of Monthly, Seasonal And Annual Time-Series. To Do So, The Data Of 15 Temperature Gauge Stations Within The Urmia Lake Basin, For The Period 19722011 Was Employed. The Pre-Whitening Approach Was Applied To Remove The Effects Of Serial Correlation In The Air Temperature Series Based On The Mann-Kendall (Mk) Test. The Results Of Ljung-Box Test Showed Positive Serial Correlation In The Tmean And Tmax Series For All Of The Stations At The 0.05 Significance Level. In The Monthly Series, The Significant Warming Trends In The Tmean Series Were More Perceptible Than The Same Ones In Tmax Series, However, Tmax Trend Was Found More Than Tmin Series. The Mannwhitney (Mw) Test Detected A Significance Upward Shift Changes In The Annual Tmean, Tmax And Tmin Series Of About 86, 73 And 80% Of The Stations, Respectively. The Average Magnitude Of Significant Warming Trends In Annual Tmean, Tmax And Tmin Series Were (+) 0.58 C, (+) 0.52 C And (+) 0.69 C Per Decade, Respectively. Furthermore, The Interpolation Maps Showed That Warming Trends In The East And West Of Urmia Lake Were More Than Southern Area. Therefore, The Results Showed That The Basin Has Suffered From Increasing Trends In The Tmean, Tmax And Tmin Over The Recent Decades. Finally, Significant Changes Were Found In 1980S And 1990S Based On The Mann-Kendall Ranks And Change Point Tests. In This Study, It Is Interesting That The Period Of Significant Changes In Warming Trends Were Close To The Beginning Of Decreasing Water Level Of The Lake.

Article	Marjani, A//Jamali, M	Role Of Exchange Flow In Salt Water Balance Of Urmia Lake	Dynamics Of Atmospheres And Oceans	In This Paper We Examine How Exchange Flow In Urmia Lake Plays A Crucial Role In Dynamics Of The Lake. Urmia Lake, A Very Large Hyper-Saline Lake Of High Ecological Significance, Is Located In Northwest Of Iran With A 15-Km Causeway Dividing It Into North And South Lakes. A 1250-M Opening In The Causeway Near The East Coast Links The Two Lakes. The Differences In Mean Water Levels And Densities Of The Two Lakes Increase In Spring Due To Large Freshwater Inflows Into The South Lake. High Evaporation Dominates The Lake In Summer. By Incorporating The Results Of A Two-Layer Hydraulics Theory Into A Mixing Model Of The Lake, We Show That The Exchange Flow Through The Opening Diminishes The Water Level And Salinity Differences Of The Two Lakes And Hence Helps Restoration Of The Pre-Construction State Of The Lake By The End Of Fall. The Model Results Are Confirmed By The Field Data. The North-South And South-North Flows Through The Opening Are Equal In Most Of The Year, Except In Spring When The South-North Flow Is Greater Due To The Head Difference Of The Two Lakes. 2013 Elsevier B.V.

This Lake Has A Great Economic, Social And Bio-Spherical Importance In Iran. It Has Faced With Enormous Water Depletion During The Recent Years. Many Studies Has Been Conducted About Climate Change, Drought, Rivers Discharge Declining And Changing In Land Use So Far That Increasing In Water Utilization In Agricultural Activities Have Taken Into Account As The Most Important Factor In Water Table Reduction Of Urmia Lake. However, There Is No Study About The Hydraulic Connection Between Lake And Its Adjacent Aquifers. Perception Of Spatial Changes In Groundwater Components That Is Resulted From Various Inputs Is A Difficult Work, Especially If Chemical Composition Or Boundary Conditions Change Over Time, As It Is Popular In Coastal Aquifers. Utilization Of Geochemistry In Different Water Resources Connection Has Done In Many Studies. Geochemists Generally Seek To Find Chemical Ratios Such As Na + /Cl + , Ca ++ /Mg ++ , Ca ++ /Hco 3 - + So 4 - And Cl - /Hco 3 - + Co 3 - And 18 O And 2 H Isotopes As Saltwater Intrusion Indicators. The Present Study For The First Time Investigates The Hydraulic Connection Between Urmia Lake And Azarshahr Plain Aquifer Using Geochemical Ratios And Geochemical Modeling. Materials And Methods: Urmia Lake Is A Kind Of The Widest And Shallowest Lakes In The World And Has Hyper Saline Water. A Lot Of Permanent And Seasonal River And Streams Feed The Lake. Broad And Unwanted Changes In Water And Ecology Of This Lake Have Been Started About 2 Decade Before And During This Time. The Water Volume Of The Lake Decreased To Less Than 14 Billion M 3 In 2011 From About 32 Billion M 3 In 1995. Azashahr Study Area Is Considered As One Of The Lake Twelve Adjacent Aquifers That Is Located Between 45,46 To 45, 50 Longitudinal And 37,43 To 37,52 Latitudinal. Its Total Area Is About 457 Km 2 That Its Plain Has An Area About 124 Km 2 . The Highest And Lowest Height In The Study Area Is 3700 M And 1282 M, Respectively. Its Average Annual Precipitation Is About 221.2 Mm Whereas The Average Annual Evaporation Is About 1579 Mm. And The Most Important Stream In Azarshahr Plain Is Azarshahrchai. It Has A Southeast-Northwest Trend And Is Eliminated To The Lake Because Of Wide Agricultural Usage. On The Other Hand, The Total Annual Discharge Of The Aquifer Is About 90.64 Million M 3 That Is One Of The Groundwater Depletion And Saltwater Intrusion Factors In The Study Area. Groundwater Salinity Is Increased In Azarshahr Plain Aquifer Because Of Wide Discharge In One Side And Decrease In Urmia Lake Water Level On The Other Hand. This Probably Shows That Saltwater Intrusion To Azarshahr Plain Aquifer Is In Relation With Water Level Decreases In Urmia Lake And Consequently Reveals The Hydraulic Connection Between Them. To Investigate This Connection, Groundwater Sampling And Analysis Were Conducted And Hydraulic Connection Evaluation Was Done Via Three Steps As Below. Graphical Methods: Three Popular Piper, Stiff And Pie Chart Graphical Method Was Selected And The Samples Were Plotted After The Analysis And Were Compared To Urmia Lake Water Samples. Star Diagram Also Was Plotted For The Samples And Their Map Was Drawn. On The Other Hand, Pie Chart That Shows The Percentage Of Water Major Components Was Calculated And Their Distribution In Study Area Was Plotted And Compared To Urmia Water Component Percentage. Geochemical Ratios: General Status Of Saline Water Is Ci - And Na + Dominance With 0.86 Molar Ratio And Of Course Ci - Exceed Over The Alkali Metals (Na + And K + ). Also, Mg ++ Is More Than Ca ++ Absolutely (I.E. Mg ++ /Ca ++ =4.5-5). On The Other Hand, Continental Fresh Water Is Known With Its Variable Composition And Its Dominant Anions Are, Hco - 3 , So 4 - And Ci - . Geochemists Try To Find Also The Below Geochemical Ratios Generally For Saltwater Intrusion Resource Determination: Na + /Cl - , Ca ++ /Mg ++ , Ca ++ /Hco 3 - + So 4 - And Ci - /Hco 3 - + Co 3 - And Also Some Isotopes Such As Boron, Oxygen And Hydrogen. In The Present Study, Geochemical Ratios Were Calculated And Plotted In Study Area For Saltwater Intrusion Resource Finding And Also Evaluation Of Hydraulic Connection Between Urmia Lake And Azarshahr Plain Aquifer. Geochemical Inverse Modeling: Hydro-Geochemical Modeling Is An Important Tool For Recognition Of Geochemical Reactions In Groundwater. In The Modeling Process, Geochemical Reactions During The Flow Path Such As Solution, Precipitation, Mixing And Cation Exchange Are Simulated And Compared With Final Water Composition. Solute Aggregation In Groundwater Can Be Supposed As A Reaction Of Water With Surrounding Minerals In Porous Media. Hydro-Geologists Utilize The Water Chemical Data For Classification Of Various Mineral Balance Situations. In This Study, Ion Activity Product (Iap) And Balance Constant (K) And Also Saturation Index (Si) Were Used For Probable Minerals, Composition Creation And Comparison With Probable Phases In Urmia Lake Water Sample. Therefore, Because Of Enormous Volume Of Calculations In Balance Reactions And Also Finding The Balance Constant For Reactions, Phreeqc Computer Code Has Been Used And Probable Phases In Groundwater Mixed Samples And Urmia Lake Water Sample Were Created And Compared To Each Other. These Were Carried Out To Find If There Is Any Chemical Connection Between Lake And Azarshahr Aquifer. The Mixed Samples Were Created In Three Paths Near The Lake. Mixing Reaction Was Done Between Samples Number 18 And 19, 20 And 23 And Also Between 25 And 22 In Porous Media Presentation. Results And Discussion: Geochemical Analysis Results Of Groundwater Samples And Urmia Lake Indicated That Dominant Cation In Azarshar Aquifer And Urmia Lake Are Ca ++ And Na + , Respectively. Also Groundwater Dominant Anions Are Hco 3 - , So 4 - And Ci - During The Flow Direction, Whereas Dominant Anion In Lake Water Is Ci That Is Distinct Characteristic Of Marine Composition. Piper Diagram Revealed That Groundwater Type In Study Area Are Ca ++ - Na + - Hco 3 - And Ca ++ -Na + -Cl - Whereas Urmia Lake Water Is In Na + -Cl - Type. The Nearest Sample To Urmia Lake Water Composition Is Sample Number 7 That Is Located Out Of Aquifer Domain And Is Affected By Anthropogenic Activities Probably. Also Stiff Diagram Of Groundwater Samples And Urmia Lake Aren'T Similar To Each Other And Show The Different Sources. Na + /Cl - Ratio In Saltwater Intrusion Is Lower Than Marine Values (I.E. Molar Ratio&Lt,0.86). On The Other Hand, Ratio More Than 1 Is The Indicator Of Anthropogenic Activities Such As Residential Area Wastewater. Na + /Cl - Ratio Distribution In The Aquifer Domain Shows That In The Northwest And West Of Aquifer, There Is Na + /Cl - Ratio Less Than Marine Ratio. Therefore, There Is Saltwater Intrusion From Northwest Of The Study Area. Also Evaluation Of Ca ++ /(Hco 3 - + So 4 - ) And Ca ++ /Mg ++ Ratios Revealed That, These Ratios In Aquifer Domain Are More Than Those In Urmia Lake Water Spectacularly. As It Can Be Clearly Seen, Minimum Value For Ca ++ /Mg ++ Ratio In Aquifer Domain Starts From About 29 And For Ca ++ /(Hco 3 - + So 4 - ) Ratio Starts From About 0.2, Whereas These Ratios Are 0.01 And 0.03 For Urmia Lake, Respectively. This Shows No Relation Between Aquifer Groundwater And Urmia Lake. Other Popular Geochemical Ratio For Saltwater Intrusion Is Reveile Ratio Explained As [Cl - /(Hco 3 - + Co 3 - )]. Ratio More Than 1.5 Depicts The Saltwater Intrusion. Reveile Distribution Plot Represented That There Is Saltwater Intrusion From Domain Northwest Direction But It Is Not From The Lake Because Of Its Direction And Also South-North Trend. Hydro-Geochemical Modeling Of Different Groundwater Sample Mixing In Flow Direction And The Nearest Distance To The Lake Has Been Indicated As A Comparsion Between Probable Phases Saturation Index. The Results Show That Mixing Of Samples Had Been Done But Probable Phases Did Not, Same As The Probable Phases In Urmia Lake Water. Conclusion: Saltwater Intrusion From Urmia Lake To Adjacent Aquifers Because Of Their Heavy Pumping Rate Is One Of Probable Factors In Water Level Depletion Of Urmia Lake. On The Other Hand, Finding The Relationship Between Different Types Of Water Resources To Each Other By Geochemistry Is A Popular Way That Have Not Been Done So Far In Urmia Lake. Therefore, Use Of Geochemistry Studies And Its Different Branches Were The Base Of This Study. At Last, After The Use Of Geochemical Ratios And Geochemistry Modeling, Their Results Indicated That There Is Saltwater Intrusion In Azarshahr Plain Aquifer, But It Is Not From Urmia Lake Water. Probably It Comes From Adjacent Salty Pans To The Aquifer.	Azarshahr, Geochemical Inverse Modelling, Hydraulic Connection, Saltwater Intrusion, Urmia Lake, Na	NA	13-15	Scopus	42	2016

Article	Mohammadpour, M//Bagheri, A	Common Pool Water Resources Management Considering A Regulator Interference: A Game Theory Approach To Derive Managerial Policies For Urmia Lake, Iran	Lakes And Reservoirs: Research And Management	An Increased Need For Water, Combined With A Scarcity Of Water Resources, Has Resulted In Serious Challenges Regarding Water Resource Management. Those Issues Have Always Been A Major Concern Of Most Research Regarding The Management And Operation Of Water Resources. Various Qualitative And Quantitative Methods, Game Theory (Gt) Being An Example, Have Been Proposed For Managing Common Pool Water Resources. This Study Adopts Gt To Address A Case Of Common Pool Water Resource Management, Including Consideration Of The Interference Of A Regulator. Urmia Lake In North-Western Iran Was Chosen As An Illustration Of A Common Source Of Water Shared Between Two Provinces Acting As Littoral Stakeholders To The Lake. Due To A Non-Cooperative Behaviour Of The Stakeholders, The Lake Is Most Likely To Dry Up. To Change The Game Situation, A Regulator Was Inserted Into The Game As A Third Player. The Game Among Players Is Investigated In Terms Of Two Static And Dynamic Game Methods. Two Strategies Are Defined For Each Player. The Equilibrium Point Will Be Achieved According To The Strategies Adopted By The Players. For Static Games, A Low-Level Equilibrium Under Non-Cooperation Conditions Is Obtained. Dynamic Games Among Players Are More Likely To Occur, Rather Than Static Games. The Equilibrium Of High-Level Productivity Will Be Obtained Under Cooperative Conditions Among The Players. 2017 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd	Common Pool Water Resources, Game Theory, Iran, Non-Cooperative Games, Regulator'S Interference, Static And Dynamic Games, Strategies, Urmia Lake, Game Theory, Pool, Regulatory Framework, Stakeholder, Strategic Approach, Water Management, Iran, Lake Urmia	10.1111/LRE.12158	85-94	Scopus	22	2017

The Initial Intention Of This Paper Is To Present An Approach For Determining The So Called Salient Times During Which The Trend Of The Shrinkage Process Is Accelerated Or Decelerated. To Find These Salient Times, A Quasi-Continuous Curve Was Optimally Fitted To The Topex Altimetry Data Within The Period 1998 To 2006. To Find The Salient Points Within This Period Of Time, The Points Of Inflections Of The Fitted Curve Is Computed Using A Second Derivative Approach. The Water Volume Was Also Computed Using 16 Cloud Free Landsat Images Of The Lake Within The Periods Of 1998 To 2006. In The First Stage Of The Water Volume Calculation, The Pixels Of The Lake Were Segmented Using The Automated Water Extraction Index (Awei) And The Shorelines Of The Lake Were Extracted By A Boundary Detecting Operator Using The Generated Binary Image Of The Lake Surface. The Water Volume Fluctuation Rate Was Then Computed Under The Assumption That The Two Successive Lake Surfaces And Their Corresponding Water Level Differences Demonstrate Approximately A Truncated Pyramid. The Analysis Of The Water Level Fluctuation Rates Were Further Extended By A Sinusoidal Curve Fitted To The Topex Altimetry Data. This Curve Was Intended To Model The Seasonal Fluctuations Of The Water Level. In The Final Stage Of This Article, The Correlation Between The Fluctuation Rates And The Precipitation And Temperature Variations Were Also Numerically Determined.

Article	Nourani, V//Farboudfam, N	Rainfall Time Series Disaggregation In Mountainous Regions Using Hybrid Wavelet-Artificial Intelligence Methods	Environmental Research	In Mountainous Regions, Rainfall Can Be Extremely Variable In Space And Time. The Need To Simulate Rainfall Time Series At Different Scales On One Hand And The Lack Of Recording Such Parameters In Small Scales Because Of Administrative And Economic Problems, On The Other Hand, Disaggregation Of Rainfall Time Series To The Desired Scale Is An Essential Topic For Hydro-Environmental Studies Of Such Mountainous Regions. Hybrid Models Development By Combining Data-Driven Methods Of Least Square Support Vector Machine (Lssvm) And Artificial Neural Network (Ann) And Wavelet Decomposition For Disaggregation Of Rainfall Time Series Are The Purpose Of This Paper. In This Study, For Disaggregating The Tabriz And Sahand Rain-Gauges Time Series, According To Nonlinear Characteristics Of Observed Time Scales, Wavelet-Least Square Support Vector Machine (Wlssvm) And Wavelet-Artificial Neural Network (Wann) Hybrid Models Were Proposed.

Article	Ozyavas, A//Khan, Sd	The Driving Forces Behind The Caspian Sea Mean Water Level Oscillations	Environmental Earth Sciences	Closed Basins Such As The Caspian Sea Rapidly Respond To Variations In Atmospheric And Geological Events. This Study Has Been Conducted To Deduce The Role Of Natural And Anthropogenic Influences On The Caspian Sea Mean Water Level Fluctuations For The Period Of 1998-2005. It Is Recognized That Climate Is The Primary Mechanism Of The Caspian Sea Mean Water Level Variations Based On The Relatively Small Differences Of The Caspian Sea Hydrologic Budget Residuals And The Caspian Sea Mean Water Level Fluctuations. This Is Further Supported By The Similarity In Water-Level Variations Of The Caspian Sea With Those Of Lake Van And Lake Urmia. On The Other Hand, The Caspian Sea Needed To Lose Some Of Its Water To Attain Water Balance Equilibrium In 2000 And 2001. The Year 2000 Showed Anomalous Seismic Activity Particularly In The Southwestern Part Of The Caspian Sea. Two Significant Earthquakes With Magnitudes Of 6.8 And 6.5 M W Occurred On November 25, 2000. The Focal Mechanisms Of These Earthquakes And Numerous Aftershocks Indicated Normal Faulting And, Therefore, Caused The Caspian Sea Lake Level To Decline In 2000. The Contribution Of Submarine Mud Volcano Eruptions To The Caspian Sea Lake Level Could Be Insignificant Based On The Comparison Of Water Budget Residuals And The Mean Water Level Variations.

Article	Rahmani, Ma//Zarghami, M	The Use Of Statistical Weather Generator, Hybrid Data Driven And System Dynamics Models For Water Resources Management Under Climate Change	Journal Of Environmental Informatics	Nowadays, The Assumption Of Stationary Patterns In Hydrologic Time Series Is Being Challenged, Mainly Because Of Climate Change And The Uncertainty Brought About By It. In This Paper, Climate Change And Impacts On Water Resources Of Zolachay In Urmia Lake Basin In Northwestern Iran Have Been Studied Comprehensively. Expected Precipitation And Temperature Changes Are Obtained From The Results Of General Circulation Models (Gcms) Approved By Ipcc Ar4 In Three Emission Scenarios Of A1B, A2, And B1. To Simulate Climate Change Conditions For Horizon 2020, Lars-Wg, As A Stochastic Weather Generator, Has Been Employed. Analyzing Results By A Kernel Density Estimator Indicates A Decrease In Annual Precipitation And A Tendency To A Warmer Climate. Then Different Data-Driven Models Such As Artificial Neural Network And M5 Model Tree, In Conjunction With Wavelet Transform, Have Been Used To Develop A Rainfallrunoff Model Of The Basin On A Monthly Time Scale. Results Show That A Warmer And Drier Climate In The Future Will Cause The Hydrograph To Have Temporal And Quantitative Changes. Operation Of The Multipurpose Zola Reservoir (Located On The Main Stream) Is Simulated Using The System Dynamics Approach. In Addition To Changes In The Runoff Of The Basin, Development Scenario Is Also Considered. Results Demonstrate Considerable Changes In The Reliability And Deficiency Measures In The Operation Of Zola Reservoir Under Climate Change Condition And Development Scenario. These Results Indicate That A Revision In The Rule Curve Of The Reservoir Is Needed.

This Problem Is The Biggest Factor For Marginalizing The Planning And Long-Term Management Of Water. The Sustainable Development Policies In Water Resources Management Of Iran Require Consideration Of The Different Aspects Of Management That Each Of Them Demands The Scientific Integrated Programs. Optimal Use Of Inter-Basin Surface And Groundwater Resources And Transfer Of Surplus Water To Adjacent Basins Are Important From Different Aspects. The Purpose Of This Study Is To Develop An Efficient Optimization Model Based On Inter-Basin Water Resources And Restoration Of Outer-Basin Water Resources. In The Proposed Model The Three Different Objectives Are As Follow Supplying Inter-Basin Water Demand, Reducing The Amount Of Water Output Of The Boundary Of Iran And Increasing Water Transfer To Adjacent Basins (Urmia Lake Basin) Are Considered. In This Model, Water Allocation Is Done Based On Consumption And Resources Priorities And Groundwater Table Level Constraints. In This Research, The Non-Dominate Sorting Genetic Algorithm Is Used For Performing The Developed Model Regarding The Complexity And Nonlinearity Of The Objectives And The Decision Variables. The Optimal Allocation Of Each Water Resources And Water Transfer To Adjacent Basin Can Be Determined By Using Of Proposed Model.

Article	Sadeghi, Z//Pirkharrati, H	Evaluation Of Salinity And Groundwater Quality Of Qalqachy Plain At The Edge Of Urmia Lake, Iran	Ecology, Environment And Conservation	In This Study In Order To Investigate The Hydro Chemical Groundwater Quality And Origin Of Aquifers Salinity Information Of 15 Selected Wells In The Region During 2013 And 2014 Were Used. The Spatial Distribution Of Groundwater Salinity Changes Of Qalqachy Was Determined By Drawing Maps Of In The Environment Of Gis Software (Arc Map). Evaluation Of Groundwater Maps Indicates That Ion Concentration In Central And Northern Parts Of Plain (Lake) Is More Than Southern Part Of The Plain (The Feed Zone Which Has Minimum Concentration). Comparison Of The Concentration Of Groundwater Tds, Cl, Na, So4 With Who Standard For Drinking Water Demonstrate That Most Groundwater Samples Have Concentrations More Than The Specified Permissible Level. Also Classification Of Groundwater Chemical Quality In Terms Of Irrigation Showed That Most Of The Samples Placed In The Range Of Too Salty And Saline Waters. Therefore, Miocene Evaporative - Clastic Deposits, Reduced Rainfall And Indiscriminate Exploitation Of Coastal Aquifers Which Cause Reduction In Groundwater Levels, Progress And Salt Water Intrusion Into Aquifers, Can Be The Reasons For The Region'S Groundwater Quality Degradation.

Article	Safaee, A//Mohammadi, Bm	Game Theoretic Insights For Sustainable Common Poll Water Resources Governance (Case Study: Lake Urmia Water Conflict)	Journal Of Environmental Studies	Introduction: Common Pool Water Resources (Cpwrs) Face Overuse And Congestion Due To Increased Competition For The Non-Excludability And Subtractability Nature Of Their Use. In The Cpwrs Conflicts, Beneficiaries Base Their Actions On Individual Rationality Which Negatively Affect All Users Eventually Due To The Lack Of Trust Between Them, Their Self-Optimizing Tendencies, And Inadequate Information About The Consequences Of Their Actions. Game Theory Provides A Formal Mathematical Framework To Strategic Analysis Of Such Conflict And To Able Presenting Some Institutions To Prevent Tragedy Of Commons. Lake Urmia Is The Most Valuable Ecosystem Located In The Same Name Basin In Iran In The Recent Years, The Basin'S Upstream Water Resources Faced To Overuse Due To An Increase In The Attitudes Of Parties To Gain More Economic Benefits From Agriculture Activities Which Led To Conflicts As Well As Threats To Lake Urmia'S Life. The Literatures Which Studied This Environmental Crisis Are Limited With Respect To Understanding Strategic Interactions Between The Actors And How Such Interactions May Affect The Results Of The Lake Urmia Water Conflict. Materials And Methods: In Order To Study The Lake Urmia Water Conflict, Basic Information Were Prepared Through A Review Of The Relative Literatures, The Technical Documents, And The News Reports. These Collected Data Were Completed By Referring To Experts Opinions And Finally The Conflict Was Modeled And Analyzed Based On The Gmcr Process Of Resolving Conflicts. As A Non-Cooperative Game Theoretical Model, The Graph Model For Conflict Resolution (Gmcr) Was Developed Through A Combination Of Extensive Form Of Conflict Analysis And Graph Theory. Figure 1 Outlines The Gmcr Process Of Resolving Conflicts Which Involves Two Main Stages Including Modeling And Analyzing. The Modeling Stage Includes Defining Decision Makers And Their Options, Removing Infeasible States Of The Conflict, Specifying Allowable Transitions From Each State For Each Player, And Finally Defining The Relative Preferences Of Each Player Over Each State. In The Analyzing Stage, Stability Of The Feasible States For Each Player Is First Analyzed Using The Formal Mathematical Definitions Named Non-Cooperative Solution Concepts. The Second Stage Is Followed By Finding The Equilibria Or Likely Outcomes Of The Conflict (States Which Are Stable For All Stakeholders Under A Given Solution Concept). If A Given State Is Known As Equilibrium Under A Range Of Solution Concepts, Then It Is A Strong Equilibrium With A Higher Likelihood Of Being The Final Outcome Of The Game. After That, Some Alternative Scenarios Are Defined In Order To Examine The Sensitivity Of The Results To Changing Input Information. Finally, Strategic Insights From Decision Makers' Interactions Are Presented To Help Them For Better Decision Making. Discussion: Of Results And Conclusions: As Can Be Seen In Table 1, There Were Five Decision Makers With Seven Options In The Lake Urmia Water Conflict. The Number Of Total States Of The Conflict Was 128 Which Reduced To 72 After Infeasible States Were Removed. Then, Allowable Moves From A Given State To Each Other And The Player'S Preferences Were Defined Respectively. Based On The Dm'S Preferences, The Ministry Of Agri-Jihad (Maj) Has Preferred To Continue Its New Agriculture Development Projects While It Has Tended To Protect The Basin'S Farmers To Improve Their Cultivation And Irrigation Styles. Although The Ministry Of Energy (Moe) Has Interested To Implement Interbasin Water Transformation Projects But It Has Not Liked To Stop Its New Water Resources Development Plans. The Basin'S Provinces (Bp) Have Disagreed To Stop Their New Local Water And Agricultural Development Plans. Farmers Of The Basin (F) Have Liked To Continue Their Illegal Overuse From Upstream Water Resources Of The Basin And The Central Government (Cg) Has Preferred To Take No Action To Force Maj, Moe, And Bp To Stop Their New Development Plans. After The Conflict Was Modeled, The Stability Analysis Was Applied Through Non-Cooperative Solution Concepts Followed By An Alternative Preference Scenario Developed In Order To Find How Changes In Decision Makers' Preferences Affect The Initial Results. According To Table 2, Eight Outcomes Became Known As The Game Equilibria. The Results Indicated That The State 6, Which Is Current Situation Of The Real World Conflict As Well As Selected As Status Quo Of The Analysis, Was Suggested As The Most Likely Outcome Of The Game In The Initial Analysis By Gmcr. It Means That Lake Urmia Crisis Mainly Rooted In Individual Rationality Based Behaviors Of Beneficiaries Which Appeared As They Persisted On Increasing Their Shares From Common Poll Resources Of The Basin Upstream. Also, It Proposed Gmcr As An Effective And Applicable Tool For Strategic Analysis And Sustainable Common Poll Water Resources Governance. Based On The Results Of Sensitivity Analysis To Move Out The Status Quo, The Central Government Should Change His Initial Preferences Through Strong Interference In The Conflict And Force The Parties To Stop Their Upstream New Developments. If Such Situation Occurs, The State 68 Will Be Chosen As The Final Resolution Of This Conflict.

Article	Saghafian, B//Hamzekhani, Fg	Hydrological Drought Early Warning Based On Rainfall Threshold	Natural Hazards	Hydrological Drought Early Warning Systems Could Greatly Improve The Efficiency Of Water Resources Allocation, Particularly In Semiarid Areas Where Extensive Storage Systems Are Constructed. On The Other Hand, Warning Systems That Rely On Meteorological Thresholds (Triggers) Are Relatively Easy To Use In Real-Time Conditions Compared With Complicated Fully Online Forecast Models. In This Study, Probabilistic Rainfall Thresholds Triggering The Hydrological Droughts Were Determined On Monthly Basis. The Case Study Region Is Urmia Lake Basin, Holding One Of The Largest Saline Lakes In The World That Is Currently Under The Drying Threat Due To Prolonged Droughts And Excessive Surface Water Use. In The First Step, The Time Series Of Total Inflow To The Urmia Lake Was Transformed To A Standardized Hydrological Drought Index. A Simple Rainfalldrought Index Model Was Also Developed At Basin Scale. Then, In An Inverse Modeling Framework, Rainfall Threshold Values Causing Different Hydrological Drought Severity Levels Under Several Occurrence Probabilities Were Determined Through Repetitive Application Of Rainfalldrought Index Model. Derived Rainfall Threshold Values Were Evaluated In A Forecast Mode Against Both Historical And Simulated Data Using The Critical Success Index. Results Revealed That The Proposed Approach Was Simple To Use And Sufficiently Accurate In Forecast Of Hydrological Droughts, While Mean Probable Threshold Curve Offered The Best Performance. 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Article	Samani, S//Moghaddam, Aa	Hydrogeochemical Characteristics And Origin Of Salinity In Ajabshir Aquifer, East Azerbaijan, Iran	Quarterly Journal Of Engineering Geology And Hydrogeology	Inverse Geochemical Modelling With Phreeqc And Multivariate Statistical Methods Were Used To Determine The Origin Of Groundwater Chemical Constituents And Identify The Source Of Salinity In Parts Of Ajabshir Alluvial Aquifer, East Azerbaijan, Iran. Q Mode Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (Hca) Was Used To Partition Groundwater In The Study Area Into Hydrochemical Facies. Three Major Water Groups Were Identified By Hca. Groundwater Samples Collected From The Study Area Were Classified As Recharge Area Waters (Group 1: Na-Ca-Hco3 Water, Group 2: Ca-Na-Hco3 Water) In The Northern, Central And Northeastern Areas. Discharge Area Waters Were Identified In The Vicinity Of Urmia Lake And In Southern Parts Of The Study Area (Group 3: Na-Cl Water). Principal Components Analysis (Pca) With Varimax Rotation Using The Kaiser Criterion Identified Three Principal Sources Of Variation In The Hydrochemistry. Factor 1 Accounts For The Salinity Of The Water, Factor 2 Represents Silicate Mineral Weathering, And Factor 3 Represents Calcite Dissolution And Incongruent Silicate Mineral Weathering. Inverse Modelling For Major Ions And The Results Of Hca Confirmed The Results Obtained With Pca. The Results Of This Study Showed That Water-Rock Interaction Is An Important Mechanism In The Evolution Of Water Chemistry. The Results Also Identified The Following Phenomena As Important Mechanisms In The Composition Of Group 3 Waters: Saline Water Upconing, Mixing Between Freshwater And Saline Water, Reverse Flow From The Salt Flats Toward The Aquifer, Flatness Of The Ground Surface And Very Low Velocity Of The Groundwater, Shallow Depth Of The Groundwater And Evaporation From It, A Silt-Clay Boundary At The Outlet Of Groundwater Flow From The Aquifer, And Airborne Transport Of Salt Particles From The Salt Flats. 2015 The Author(S).

Article	Shokoohi, A//Morovati, R	Basinwide Comparison Of Rdi And Spi Within An Iwrm Framework	Water Resources Management	This Study Intends To Evaluate The Performance Of Rdi And Spi In Lake Urmia Basin, Iran. The Data Base Used In This Research Was Gpcc For Precipitation And Ncep/Ncar For Temperature. This Study Aims Not Only To Evaluate The Performance Of Rdi And Spi, But Also To Find Out The Reason Of Urmia Lake Drying Up As Second Largest Hyper Saline Lake In The World. According To The Results, Urmia Lake Basin Faced The Most Severe Drought Condition In The Past Half Century In 19982000, And Afterwards It Could Not Enter Into A Suitable Wet State During The Later Years. Although It Was Found That Both Spi And Rdi Performance In Drought Recognition Was Acceptable And Matched In Many Cases, Nevertheless, It Was Concluded That Rdi Is More Sensitive To Severe Drought. While Spi Had No Long Term Trend, Rdi Showed Negative Trend And An Abrupt Change In Around 1996 Which Could Be Addressed As A Consequence Of Global Warming. These Characteristics Gave A Better Perspective Of Drought Phenomenon Across The Basin And Introduced Rdi As A Conservative And Reliable Tool For Studying Drought In The Urmia Lake Basin. In This Study, It Was Acknowledged That Drought Cannot Be The Only Reason For The Lake Drying Up, Because It Was Indicated That Precipitation Over The Basin Has Been Close To Its Long-Term Average In Recent Years While The Lake Level Is Continuously Declining. Human Activities Such As Dam Construction During The Drought Periods, And Also Activities Like Extensive Fish Farming In Rivers Leading To Urmia Lake And Overexploiting Of Surface And Groundwater Resources Could Be Effective In Intensifying The Natural Drought Effects. The Current Status Of The Urmia Lake, Once Again Emphasizes The Importance Of Integrated Water Resources Management And Establishing A Drought Monitoring System In All Basins, In Which Using Indices Like Rdi Can Play A Fundamental Role. 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

Article	Sima, S//Tajrishy, M	Using Satellite Data To Extract Volume-Area-Elevation Relationships For Urmia Lake, Iran	Journal Of Great Lakes Research	Urmia Lake In The Northwest Of Iran Is The Second Largest Hyper-Saline Lake Worldwide. During The Past Two Decades, A Significant Water Level Decline Has Occurred In The Lake. The Existing Estimations For The Lake Water Balance Are Widely Variable Because The Lake Bathymetry Is Unknown. The Main Focus Of This Study Is To Extract The Volume-Area-Elevation (V-A-L) Characteristics Of Urmia Lake Utilizing Remote Sensing Data And Analytical Models. V-A-L Equations Of The Lake Were Determined Using Radar Altimetry Data And Their Concurrent Satellite-Derived Surface Data. Next, Two Approximate Models, A Power Model (Pm) And A Truncated Pyramid Model (Tpm), Were Parameterized For Urmia Lake And Checked For Accuracy. Results Revealed That In Comparison With The Satellite-Derived Reference Volume-Elevation Equation, The Pm Slightly Over-Predicts The Volume Of Urmia Lake While The Tpm Under-Estimates The Lake Storage. Variations Of The Lake Area And Volume Between 1965 And 2011 Were Examined Using The Developed V-A-L Equations. Results Indicated That The Lake Area And Volume Have Declined From The Historical Maximum Values By 2200Km2 And 33Km3, Respectively. To Restore Urmia Lake To A Level To Maintain Ecological Benefits, 13.2Km3 Of Water Is Required. This Study Demonstrates The Use Of Remote Sensing Data Of Different Types To Derive V-A-L Equations Of Lakes. Substituting Satellite-Derived V-A-L Equations For Common Empirical Formulas Leads To More Accurate Estimations Of A Lake Water Balance, Which In Turn, Provides Insight To Water Managers For Properly Assessing And Allocating Water Resources To Downstream Ecosystems. 2013 International Association For Great Lakes Research.

Article	Sima, S//Tajrishy, M	Developing Water Quality Maps Of A Hyper-Saline Lake Using Spatial Interpolation Methods	Scientia Iranica	Urmia Lake, The Second Largest Hyper-Saline Lake In The World, Has Experienced A Significant Drop In Water Level During The Last Decade. This Study Was Designed To Examine The Water Quality Of Urmia Lake And To Characterize The Spatial Heterogeneity And Temporal Changes Of The Physiochemical Parameters Between October 2009 And July 2010. Two Spatial Interpolation Methods, Inverse Distance Weighting (Idw) And Ordinary Kriging (Ok), Were Used And Compared With Each Other To Derive The Spatial Distribution Of Ionic Constituents As Well As Tds And Density Along The Lake. Results Showed That The Main Dominant Cations And Anions In Urmia Lake Were Na+, Mg++, K+, Ca++, Cl-, So-4, And Hco-3, Respectively. Although Water Quality Of The Lake Is Homogeneous With Depth, It Differs Between The Northern And Southern Parts. Water Quality Also Varies Seasonally, Determined By River Inflows And The Lake Bathymetry. Moreover, With The Present Salinity Level, Salt Precipitation Is Likely In Urmia Lake And Is Becoming One Of The Principal Factors Determining The Distribution Of Solutes Within The Lake. This Study Shows That The Combined Use Of Temporal And Spatial Water Quality Data Improves Our Understanding Of Complex, Large Aquatic Systems Like Urmia Lake. 2015 Sharif University Of Technology.

Artifacts Excavated From The Site Of Hasanlu, Northwest Iran	Materials Research Society Symposium - Proceedings	The Site Of Hasanlu Is Located Southwest Of Lake Urmia (Lake Rezaiyeh) In The Province Of Western Azerbaijan, Northwest Iran. Excavations Carried Out By Dr. R. H. Dyson, Jr. Of The University Of Pennsylvania From 1957 To 1977 Of The Iron Age Levels At Hasanlu Yielded A Large Number Of Glass Beads, As Well As Glass Vessels, And Glass Furniture Inlays Or Wall Fittings. Sampling Of Many Of These Pieces Was Limited To Weathered Areas, Requiring The Use Of A Micro-Analytical Technique To Characterize The Glass. Electron Microprobe And Wavelength Dispersive Analysis Were Used To Characterize The Chemical Compositions Of The Glasses Of Hasanlu. The Glasses Are Soda-Lime-Silica In Composition, Containing About 17-21 Wt% Soda And 2-8 Wt% Lime. Of 51 Glasses Analyzed To Date, 47 Contain About 1-6 Wt% Of Magnesia And 1-4 Wt% Potash, Indicative Of A Plant Ash Source Of Alkali. Four Glasses Contain Less Than 1 Wt% Each Of Magnesia And Potash, Suggesting That These May Have Been Made With A Mineral Alkali Source Like Natron. At Least 35 Glasses Contain Inclusions Of Partly Reacted Batch Materials. In Blue Transparent To Translucent, Black Translucent, And Yellow Opaque Glasses, Large, 0.2 Mm Diameter, Droplets Of Alkali Sulfates Exhibit Features That Indicate They Were An Immiscible Liquid Coexisting With A Surrounding Silicate Liquid. These Sulfate Droplets, Which Appear To Be Relatively Common In The Glasses Found At Hasanlu, Are Probably The Scum Or Gall That Can Form During Melting Of Poorly Prepared Plant Ash. Remnants Of Original Raw Colorants Occur In A Few Glasses. Many Of The Black Glasses Contain Polymetallic Sulfides Of Different Combinations Of Lead, Copper, Antimony, And Iron.

Article	Vaheddoost, B//Aksoy, H	Structural Characteristics Of Annual Precipitation In Lake Urmia Basin	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	Precipitation As The Main Process That Brings Evaporated Water From The Oceans To The Lands Surface Is A Critical Role Player In Lake Urmia Basin (Iran). As A Hyper-Saline Lake Declared As Unescos Biosphere Reserve In Ramsar Convention, It Is Dealing With Gradual Atrophy. In This Study, Characteristics Of Annual Precipitation In The Lake Urmia Basin Are Investigated By Means Of Several Statistical Measures And Tests. Data In 53 Meteorological Stations Widespread Across The Basin For A Period Of 31Years From 1981 To 2011 Are Considered For Analysis. Fundamental Statistical Characteristics Of The Data Like Mean, Maximum, Minimum, Standard Deviation, Coefficient Of Variation, Coefficient Of Skewness, Coefficient Of Kurtosis, Auto-Correlation And Cross-Correlation Coefficients Of The Annual Precipitation Are Calculated. Entropy In Each Station Is Also Calculated With Respect To The Long-Run Mean Precipitation Of The Basin. Results Of The Analysis Are Plotted In Contour Maps. Several Tests For Consistency, Randomness, Trend And Best-Fit Probability Distribution Function Are Applied To Investigate Characteristics Of The Annual Precipitation. Heterogeneity And Dependence On Local Conditions Are The Main Results Revealed By This Study While Consistency And Dependency Of Precipitation On North West And West Of The Basin Are Considered As The Most Effective Among Other Regions. Due To The North-South Oriented Mountains, A Relatively Sharp Decline In The Precipitation From West To East Can Be Compared To The Gradual Decline In Precipitation From Northtosouth Due To Smooth Change In The Terrain. It Is Also Seenthat Such Characteristics As Probability Distribution, Consistency, Randomness, Trend, And Uncertainty Of Annual Precipitation In The Lake Urmia Basin Become More Complex As Crossing From West To East Than Crossing From North To South On The Basin. 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.

Article	Vaheddoost, B//Aksoy, H	Interaction Of Groundwater With Lake Urmia In Iran	Hydrological Processes	Being A Large Hyper-Saline Water Body, Lake Urmia In North-Western Iran Deals With A Gradual Decline In Its Water Level. Most Of The Studies On Lake Urmia Have Neglected The Groundwater Issue. In This Study, As A Direct Approach, The Interaction Between The Groundwater Level And The Lake Water Level Is Investigated Both In Time And Space By Analysing The Groundwater Data Compiled From Observation Wells Surrounding The Lake. Baseflow Separation Is Considered As An Indirect Approach To Understand The Groundwater Contribution To The River Network Flowing Into The Lake. It Is Determined That About 70% Of Run-Off In The Rivers Draining Into The Lake Is Born In The Form Of Baseflow. An Interaction Between The Lake And The Groundwater Storage Is Clearly Seen From The Analysis To Conclude That Groundwater Has A Potential To Recharge The Lake. Thus, The Shrinkage Of Water Level In Lake Urmia Could Be Expected To Accelerate With The Drastic Use Of Groundwater, Which Will Be A Disaster With No Return. 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

Article	Vaheddoost, B//Kocak, K	Temporal Dynamics Of Monthly Evaporation In Lake Urmia	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	As A Unesco Biosphere, Lake Urmia Is A Shallow Hypersaline Lake Which Is Facing A Rapid Water Surface Degradation. Evaporation From The Surface Of The Lake, As A Physical Process Which Accelerates The Lakes Degradation, Was Evaluated Using Chaos Theory. Seven Hydrometeorological Stations Scattered Around The Lake Were Selected, And A 40-Year Time Span Between October 1974 And September 2014 Was Used At Each Station. Missing Data In Time Series Was Removed And The Whole Time Series Was Tested For Consistency, Randomness, And Presence Of Trend. Since Evaporation At Each Station Was Measured By Means Of Class A Evaporation Pan, Time Series At Each Station Was Multiplied By A Pan Coefficient To Incorporate The Effect Of Saline Water And Free Water Surface Environment Simultaneously. Measurement Errors Arising From Assumption Of Zero Evaporation In Winter Were Removed From The Time Series Using Locally Weighted Scatterplot Smoothing Method After Which Unification Of Time Series Into A Single Time Series Is Achieved. Results Of The Data Transformation And Information Loss Were Monitored By Means Of Auto-Correlation, Partial-Auto-Correlation, Mutual Information, Power Spectrum, False Nearest Neighbor, And Correlation Dimension. A Local Prediction Method Is Then Used To Capture The Temporal Dynamics Of The Evaporation With Consideration Of An Appropriate Time Delay And Embedding Dimension. Finally, The Representative Model Was Projected On A 3-Dimensional Phase Space To Evaluate The Temporal Dynamics Of The Evaporation. Results Indicate That The Chaotic Approach Shows Accurate Predictions In Advance. 2019, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Austria, Part Of Springer Nature.

In Recent Decades The Imprudent Industrial Development Accompanied By Continuous Use Of Groundwater Aquifers Has Been One Of The Most Pivotal Reasons For This Crisis. Water Level Monitoring And Detection Of Its Changes Within Urmia Lake As Well As The Surrounding Environment In The Past 60 Years Integrating Gis, Remote Sensing And Photogrammetric Methods Is The Main Goal For This Study. In Order To Accomplish This, Aerial Photogrammetry Images And Derived Topographic Maps From Them For The Year 1955, Digital Elevation Data, Quantitative And Qualitative Information Regarding Water Wells And Lake Urmia Respectively And Finally Remotely Sensed Images Of Landsat Tm, Etm+ And Oli Sensors Were Used. The Temporal Range For The Study Was Set To 60 From The Year 1955 To 2014. Scrutinizing 12 Images Relating To Different Periods, Vast Changes In Both Area And Perimeter Of The Lake Were Detected. Based On The Results, The Lake Area Has Decreased From 451800 Hectares In 1955 To 89730 In Recent Years Due To Various Causative Factors. It Is Also Found That The Highest Water Recession, Which Caused Increasing Coastal Salty Areas, Has Been Occurred In The Southern Parts Of The Lake. While The Receding Water Level Of The Lake Has A Deep Correlation With The Increasing Agricultural Activities Around The Lake, It Has A Reverse Relation With The Lake Water Ec. These Fluctuations Can Be Detrimental To The Environment, Economy And Society. Looking At The Changes In Lake Urmia, If The Current Situation Keeps On And No Drastic Measures Are Taken, Turning Into A Salt Land, The Lake Would Be Completely Disappeared Till 2033. Authors 2018.

Article	Yasi, M//Ashori, M	Environmental Flow Contributions From In-Basin Rivers And Dams For Saving Urmia Lake	Iranian Journal Of Science And Technology - Transactions Of Civil Engineering	Dramatic Shrinkage Of The Internationally Registered Urmia Lake, Iran, Is Mainly Related To The Reduction In Rivers Flowing Into The Lake. This Flow Reduction Is Due To Irrigation Of Agricultural Lands Upstream Of The Lake. The Potential Flows Into The Lake Are Greatly Influenced By Ten Perennial Rivers, Hosting 24 Large Dams. Among These Is The Zarine River, The Largest, Which Contributes To 41 % Of Surface Water Flows Into The Lake. The River Flows Are Controlled By The Bukan Dam, The Largest Reservoir In The Lake Basin. The Riverine Lives In The Basin Are Increasingly Degraded, And The Recipient Lake Is Drying Up. Allocation Of Environmental Water Requirements Is Of Main Priorities For Restoration Of The Lake. The Ecological Needs Of The River Were Investigated In Three Different Reaches, Upstream And Downstream Of The Bukan Dam. This Paper Presents A Framework To Address The Evaluation Of Minimum Environmental Flows In This River System From Nine Eco-Hydro Methods. The Overall Results Indicate That 17 To 35 % Of Mean Annual Flow (Maf) Should Be Allocated For Maintaining An Acceptable Minimum Environmental Requirement For Saving The Urmia Lake. The Allocated Environmental Flow Releases From The Bukan Dam Is To Be Increased From Currently 9 To 35 % Of Maf. The Contribution From Major Rivers Surroundings The Urmia Lake Is Also Presented.

Conference Paper	Yazdandoost, F//Khorami, N	Integrated Sediment Transport Modelling For Rivers Feeding Lakes And Wetlands	River Sedimentation - Proceedings Of The 13Th International Symposium On River Sedimentation, Isrs 2016	Variation In Normal Sediments Transported In Rivers And Watercourses, Primarily Due To Excessive Utilisation And Rapid Land Use Changes In The Basin, May Threaten Sensitive Receiving Wetlands And Lakes. Loss Of Operational Volumes As A Result Of Reductions In Supply And Disruptions In The Performance Of Wetlands In Terms Of Quality And Ecosystem Are Some Of The Resulting Adverse Impacts Amongst Many. A Toolbox Has Been Designed Here To Address The Issue Based On Sustainability Criteria. The Toolbox Comprises An Estimating Engine For The Sediment Transport, Namely The Swat Model, A Powerful Gis Tool And A Multi Criteria Decision Making (Mcdm) Tool. Flow Variations As Well As Nitrate Concentrations Would Also Be Investigated Alongside Sediment Quantities For Various Potential Scenarios. Ranking Of Individual And Combined Scenarios May Be Obtained Based On Decision Makers Priorities While The Toolbox Has The Capability To Incorporate Various Desired Sustainability Criteria. The Toolbox Has Been Utilised For The Case Of Zarineh-Rud River Basin Feeding Lake Urmia. Lake Urmia, One Of The Largest Saltwater Lakes On Earth And A Highly Endangered Ecosystem, Is On The Brink Of A Major Environmental Disaster Similar To The Catastrophic Death Of The Aral Sea. Once With A Surface Area Of Approximately Half A Million Hectares, Lake Urmias Shoreline Has Been Receding Severely With No Sign Of Recovery, Leading To A Significant Shrinkage In The Lakes Surface Area Currently Decreased By Around 88%. Lake Urmia Is Fed By A Total Of 60 (21 Seasonal Or Permanent, And 39 Periodic) Rivers With The Zarrine-Rud Being The Main Input, Reckoned To Provide Around 37% Of The Total Inflow Into The Lake. Evidently Sediment Transport Conditions In Zarine-Rud Will Have Grate Impacts Both On The Morphology Of The River Course And The Sensitive Conditions Of Lake Urmia. Results Obtained Using The Toolbox Indicates That Impacts Of Erosion And Sedimentation In River Basins And Receiving Lakes And Wetlands May Be Effectively Investigated Under Various Development Scenarios Thereby Providing A Decision Support Tool For Operation And Planning. 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, London.

Article	Yazdandoost, F//Yazdani, Sa	A New Integrated Portfolio Based Water-Energy-Environment Nexus In Wetland Catchments	Water Resources Management	Increasing Demand Of Vital Resources Such As Water And Energy Will Impose Some Overwhelming Environmental Degradation, Particularly On Wetlands As The Most Vulnerable Bodies Of The Environment. Consequently, Optimization Of Water And Energy Portfolios Have Been Widely Studied In Order To Ensure Environmental Sustainability And To Consider The Constraints Simultaneously. In This Study Improving The Security Of Portfolios Has Been Performed Based On Resource Security Index To Find Non-Dominated Portfolios (Pareto Frontier). Non-Dominated Portfolios As Scenarios To Remediate Water Bankruptcy Have Been Developed And Probable Environmental Impacts Have Been Assessed. A New Financial-Environmental Index Called Water-Energy-Environment Nexus Security Index (Weensi) Have Been Utilized Through A Multi Criteria Decision Making Approach To Find Admiringly Compatible Non-Dominated Water And Energy Portfolios For Environmental Remediation Purposes In The Case Of The Lake Urmia Catchment As An Epitome Of Water Bankruptcy Situation. Results Indicate That Portfolio Based Management Approaches Could Be A Desired Solution To Water Bankruptcy And An Inspiring Option For Environmental Remediation, Particularly In Wetland Catchments. It Has Further Become Known That Persisting On The Conventional Water Resources Management In This Catchment Will Increase Water Demand Of Energy Sector Up To More Than 500 Million Cubic Meters (Mcm) In 2060, Exacerbating The Current Critical Environmental Condition. Also, Increasing The Share Of Renewable Energies At Least Up To 40% Must Be Taken Into Account By Managers And Policy Makers. Broadly Speaking, Any Development Of Energy Sector Requires An Urgent Change In The Currently Practiced Approach And Considerable Investment In Non-Conventional Energy Resources. The Increase In Primary Costs Of Optimizing And Improving The Water And Energy Portfolios May Alleviate The Anthropogenic Impacts With High Social Costs To The Region. 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

Review	Zabihian, F//Fung, As	Review Of Marine Renewable Energies: Case Study Of Iran	Renewable And Sustainable Energy Reviews	The Objective Of This Paper Is To Briefly Review The State-Of-The-Art In The Harnessing Of Marine Energy And Study The Positions And Features Of The Boundary And Domestic Seas And Lakes Of Iran From Energy Point Of View And The Possibility Of Using These Energy Resources. Generally, The Energy Potentials In The Seas And Oceans Are Classified In Five Groups: Wave Energy, Tidal Energy, Ocean Thermal Energy, Ocean Current Energy, And Salinity Gradient Energy. Due To The Variety Of Iran'S Bodies Of Water, Other Than Ocean Current Energy, It Is Possible To Use The Rest Of These Energy Resources. Each Body Of Water Of Iran Is Suitable For A Specific Kind Of Marine Energy. There Are Great Sources Of Tidal Energy In The Persian Gulf Coasts. For Thermal Energy, The Ideal Sites Are Located In The Caspian Sea Coasts, And Wave Energy Can Economically Be Extracted In The Gulf Of Oman Coasts As Well As In Remote Islands Which Are Off-Grid. Finally, Urmia Lake Is The Best Location For Salinity Gradient Energy. This Study Shows That More Investment Is Required In This Area For Research And Small Scale Pilot Plants In Order To Exploit Such Renewable Resources. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All Rights Reserved.

The Geotechnical Investigation At The Urmia Lake Bridge Site, Were Conducted From December 2002 To September 2003. Four Boreholes Were Drilled Up To 100 Meters From The Lakebed, And The Exhumed Soil Samples Were Tested For Soil Mechanical And Geotechnical Characteristics. Fifteen Core Samples From Two Boreholes Were Selected And Their Pore Water Was Squeezed Using The Pneumatic Soil Pore Water Squeeze Apparatus. The Squeezed Pore Water Samples Were Analyzed For Chloride, Sodium, And Calcium Concentrations, And Ph, Salinity And Electrical Conductivity. The Urmia Lake Water Was Sampled And Tested For The Same Parameters. The Resulted Values From The Lake Water And Boreholes Pore Water Samples Were Plotted Against Bore Holes Depth. The Resulted Chloride And Sodium Concentration Profiles Were Almost Uniform Against Soil Depth, But The Calcium Concentrations Showed A Gradual Increase Against Boreholes Depth. The Ph, Salinity And Electrical Conductivity Values In The Pore Water Samples Were Almost Uniform Against Boreholes Depth. The Pore Water Values In The Lake Bed Deposits Were Consistent With The Lake Water Values For The Same Chemical Parameters. This Is Believed To Be Due To The Long Term Sedimentation And Diffusion In A Saline Environment. Four Soil Samples From Two Boreholes Were Selected For The Complete Mineralogical Analysis. The Samples Were Analyzed By Xrf And Xrd Methods And The Percentages Of The Dominated Minerals In Each Soil Sample Were Determined. The Silica Mineral (Si0 2) Dominated In All Soil Samples.

The Pollen Evidence Indicates That Artemisia Steppe Dominated The Area Up To About 9000 Yr B.P. Precipitation, Possibly In The Form Of Torrential Showers, Ran Off Directly To The Lake Basin. Some Increase In Precipitation Enabled A Grass Steppe To Develop During The Middle Part Of The Late Glacial. During This Period Detrital Minerals Were Hardly Transported To The Lake. It Is Assumed That The Increase In Precipitation Caused An Increase In Vegetation Cover Which In Turn Prevented Direct Run-Off. Between 9000 And 8000 Yr B.P.

Review	Castelluccia, M	Iron Age Fortresses In Transcaucasia	Rossijskaja Arheologija	The Territory Between The Upper Reaches Of The Euphrates, The Taurus Mountains And Lake Urmia, Which, Starting From The 9Th Century Bc, Saw The Emergence Of The Urartian Kingdom, Is Indeed A Mosaic Of Regional Powers. New Investigations And Research Methods Have Significantly Added A New Perspective Of Our Knowledge Of The Cultural Landscape Of Ancient Transcaucasia. One Of The Most Important Links That Connects The Urartian Period To Earlier Ones Is Fortresses. Towards The End Of The Late Bronze Age (15Th 13Th Cc. Bce) In The Armenian Highland And In Adjoining Regions The Structure Of Society Was Rapidly Becoming More Complex, With The Military Component Gaining Crucial Importance. So-Called Cyclopean Fortresses Begin To Appear In Strategically Important Places, Usually On Elevations And Rocky Mountain Slopes. The Criteria For Creating A Topology Of The Fortified Settlements Are The Perimeter Of The Walls And The Purpose Of The Edifice (Biscione, 2002). On The Basis Of These Parameters Cyclopean Fortified Settlements Can Be Divided Into Three Main Types: Watchtowers, Forts And Fortresses Proper. The Strategic Role Of These Structures Could Have Been Active (Control Over Economic Resources) Or Passive (Place Of Refuge). Even Though We Have Testimony Of A Well-Developed Network Of Fortified Settlements, It Is Often Impossible To Identify, For Instance, The Centers From Which Subordinate Fortresses Could Have Been Controlled. The Gradual Militarization Of Society, As Reflected In The Creation Of A Network Of Fortresses, Is Also Illustrated By Other Types Of Archaeological Data. This Process Of Militarization Was Connected With The Peculiar Evolution Of The Cultures Of The Highlands. 2018 Izdatel'Stvo Nauka. All Rights Reserved.

Article	Fathian, F	Dynamic Memory Of Urmia Lake Water-Level Fluctuations In Hydroclimatic Variables	Theoretical And Applied Climatology	Dynamic Changes In Hydroclimatic Variables (Hc) And Their Effects On Fluctuations Of Water-Level (Wl) Are An Important Issue In Order To Properly Manage Available Water Resources. The Present Study Presents An Original View Of The Modeling Of Monthly Wl Fluctuations Of Urmia Lake (Ul), Northwestern Iran, During 19862016. In Order To Study The Nonlinear Association Between Wl And Hc, The Hybrid Of Linear Autoregressive Moving Average With Exogenous Variable (Armax) And Nonlinear Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (Garch) As Well As The Multivariate Garch (Mgarch) Time Series Models Are Used. The Fitted Models Identified Streamflow, Temperature, Precipitation, Wind Speed, Relative Humidity, And Day Length As The Affecting Factors On The Wls Time-Varying Mean And Variance. There Are Significant Relationships Between The Dynamic Behavior Of Conditional Covariances Of Hc And Wl, Showing That Wl Depends Relatively Strong On Weather Conditions. The Highest Depth Of Memory In This Dynamic Process Is Related To Streamflow. The Results Show That This Association Between Hc And Wl Is More Powerful When Uls Wl Has Been More Than 1274M And Does Not Seem To Change Linearly Through Time. The Results Of This Study Are Useful To Understand Uls Wl Dynamic Behavior Under The Influence Of Weather Conditions. 2019, Springer-Verlag Gmbh Austria, Part Of Springer Nature.

Article	Khalilian, M	Experimental Investigation And Theoretical Modelling Of Heat Transfer In Circular Solar Ponds By Lumped Capacitance Model	Applied Thermal Engineering	The Present Study Develops A Lumped Capacitance Model For Modelling The Heat Transfer In A Salinity Gradient Solar Pond. This Model Is Used To Analyze The Transient Energy Behaviour In Each Zone Of The Pond Incorporating Many Processes That Affect The Performance Of A Solar Pond. The Effect Of Various Parameters Such As Different Solar Attenuation Models, Thickness Of Each Zone, Heat Loss From The Pond'S Surface, And The Wall-Shading Effect On The Temperature Of The Storage Zone Would Be Investigated. The Validity Of The Model Is Tested Against Experimental Data For A Small Circular Pond Constructed In Urmia University, And A Good Agreement Between Theoretical And Experimental Data For The Temperature In The Storage Zone Has Been Obtained. The Results Indicated That The Heat Loss From The Pond'S Surface Occurs Mostly By Evaporation Rather Than Radiation And Convection. In Addition, It Is Observed That The Upper Convective Zone Thickness Should Be As Thin As Possible And The Lower Convective Zone Thickness May Be Designed Based On The Application Needs. It Is Concluded That Wall-Shading Effect Has A Significant Effect On The Storage Temperature Of A Small Pond, However, The Effect Is Found To Be Small In The Large Pond. 2017 Elsevier Ltd	Experimental Data, Heat Transfer, Lumped Capacitance Model, Solar Energy, Solar Pond, Capacitance, Digital Storage, Heat Losses, Heat Transfer, Lakes, Solar Energy, Solar Ponds, Capacitance Model, Experimental Data, Experimental Investigations, Lower Convective Zones, Radiation And Convection, Salinity Gradient Solar Ponds, Storage Temperatures, Theoretical Modelling, Lumped Parameter Networks	10.1016/J.APPLTHERMALENG.2017.04.129	737-749	Scopus	121	2017

Article	Mahmoudzadeh, A	Vegetation Cover Plays The Most Important Role In Soil Erosion Control	Pakistan Journal Of Biological Sciences	To Obtain, Characteristics And Behaviors Of Soil Erosion Phenomena, To Control It'S Harms And Reduce It'S Risks, Realistic Data From Soil Erosion Rates Are Necessary. Mean While, Measuring Soil Erosion Rates Particularly In Large Scale Is A Time Consuming And Expensive Task. Moreover, Spatial And Temporal Changes Of Soil Erosion Increase This Problem. Therefore, To Find Out A Certain Way Of Creating Capable Methods Which Easily And Quickly Be Able To Estimate Soil Erosion Rate, Is Quite Logical. So, Different Models Are Widely Used, But, May Be The Most Important Consideration With This Regard Is That, These Models Should Be Previously, Tested And Adopted To Defined Areas To Stop Probability Of Causing Some Huge And Meaningful Errors. Therefore, To Achieve The Above Mentioned Aim, Different Methods Are Used. Anyway, Conditions Which Resulted To Create A Suitable Model, Should Be Considered In A Defined Area Where, Model Is Applied, Unless, Model Application Can Leads To Huge Risks. This Study Is An Attempt With This Refer, That Is, With Comparing Measured Soil Loss Rates And Predicted Soil Erosion Rates From A Defined Catchment Area, Created A Reasonable Relationship Between Them And Achieved The Main Aim Of The Study. That Is, One Of The Small Upland Catchments Of Emam Kandi Of Urmia With 75 Ha Area Which Is Part Of The Urmia Lake Catchment Area And Under Layned By Calcareous Parent Material, Is Selected As A Study Site. Selected Catchment Has Natural Pasture And Has Closured During The Recent Years. To Calculate Sediment Yield The Following Processes Were Done: First, Estimating The Volume Of Trapped Sediments, Then, Surveying The Catchment Area, For Calculating Sediment Yield. Measured Sediment Yield Is 6.19 T Ha-1 Year-1 Which Leads To Soil Loss Rate Of 13.76 T Ha-1 Year-1 By Using Sediment Delivery Ratio (Sdr). Also, Inside The Measurement Of Sediment Yields And Calculation Of Soil Loss Rates, Two Models Of Musle And Psiac Were Used Respectively After Exclosure And Before Exclosure To Predict Soil Loss Rates. Predicted Soil Loss Rates By Musle And Psiac Respectively Are 12.80 And 26.5 T Ha-1 Year-1. Finally, Comparisons And Statistical Analysis And Scientific Discussions Were Made. 2007 Asian Network For Scientific Information.

Article	Mohajjel, M	Quaternary Travertine Ridges In The Lake Urmia Area: Active Extension In Nw Iran	Turkish Journal Of Earth Sciences	The Lake Urmia Area Is Surrounded By Several Major Active Oblique-Slip Faults With Dextral And Normal Offsets. Extensive Travertine Ridges Were Produced Along The E-W Up To Nw-Se Trending Extension Fractures In The Lake Urmia Area, Nw Iran. These Fractures Are Parallel To Subparallel With Abundant Normal Faults. Pliocene-Quaternary Volcanic Domes Occur In The Area And Their Activities Tend Toward Apparent Distinction Between Colored Travertine Layers And Ridges. Two Different Modes Of Banded Travertine Within The Fissures And Layered Travertine On The Surface Are Observed. Some Banded Travertines Are Not Vertical And Obviously Were Tilted. Layered Travertines Were Cut, Rotated, And Displaced Sequentially By Nw-Se Oriented Normal Faults. Local Collapsed Areas Are Produced Subparallel To The Extension Fractures, Implying That Extension In The Area Has Continued To Recent Time. We Conclude That Extensive Deposition Of Travertine Is Produced Along Extension Fractures With Volcanic Activity And Active Oblique-Slip Normal Faults Indicating Regional Extension In The Lake Urmia Area. The Lake Urmia Area In Nw Iran Is Not Only Situated In An Active Tectonic Region In Junction With Anatolia, Escaping To The West, And The Iranian Microcontinent, Escaping To Southeast Along The Major Strike-Slip Faults, But It Is Also Located At The Extension Termination Of The Main Recent Fault.

Because Of The Different Null Hypothesis Of These Two Tests, Their Power Varies In Different Stationarity Cases. The Problem Arises When The Results Of Adf And Kpss Test Are Against Each Other For The Same Time Series. In The Current Study, The Power Of These Two Statistical Tests Is Investigated With A Set Of Artificial Hydrological Time Series. Results Indicate That Both Adf And Kpss Test Are Unable To Detect Second Order Stationarity And Kpss Is Sensitive To Outliers. Then, Sequent Combination Of Adf And Kpss Introduced As Ak Test. The Ak Test Is Able To Identify First Order Stationarity, First Order Non-Stationarity (Unit Root) And Long Memory.

Article	Nouri, Gheidari, Mh	Comparisons Of The L- And Lh-Moments In The Selection Of The Best Distribution For Regional Flood Frequency Analysis In Lake Urmia Basin	Civil Engineering And Environmental Systems	Design Flood Estimation Is An Important Task That Is Required In The Planning And Design Of Many Civil Engineering Projects. Finding The Most Suitable Distribution To Flood Samples And Selecting The Appropriate Parameter Estimation Method Are Of Great Importance For Flood Frequency Analysis. In This Study, L-Moments And Lh-Moments Have Been Used To Characterise The Upper Part Of Distributions And Larger Events In Flood Data. Three Extreme Value Distributions, That Is, Generalised Extreme Value (Gev), Generalised Logistic (Glo) And Generalised Pareto (Gpa), Through Different Levels Of The Lh-Moments Have Been Applied To Describe The Annual Maximum Flood Data Obtained From 34 Sites In Lake Urmia Basin, Northwest Iran. The Performances Of These Distributions Have Been Assessed By Evaluating The Relative Root-Mean-Square Error And The Minimum L-Kurtosis Difference Criterion. The Result Shows That The Lh-Moments Are More Efficient For Obtaining Improved Values Of Flood Peaks Than The L-Moments. For The Upper Part Of Distributions, The Gev Distribution Using The L2-Moment Is The Best, Followed By The Glo Distribution Using The L1-Moment And The Gpa Distribution Using The L3-Moment. The Glo Distribution Using The L-Moments Methods Is The Best Among All Distributions For A Complete Data Series. 2013 Copyright Taylor And Francis Group, Llc.

Review	Rodriguez, Merchan, Ec	Topical Therapies For Knee Osteoarthritis	Postgraduate Medicine	Background: Symptomatic Knee Osteoarthritis (Oa) Involves Millions Of Adults Around The World. Purpose: To Analyze The Effectiveness And Tolerability Of Topical Therapies And Their Contemporary Placement In Knee Oa Management Criteria. Methods: A Cochrane Library And Pubmed (Medline) Search Related To The Role Of Topical Therapies In Knee Oa Was Carried Out. Results: Many Types Of Local Therapy Have Been Reported, Including Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (Nsaids) Like Diclofenac And Ketoprofen, Capsaicin, Cream Containing Glucosamine Sulfate, Chondroitin Sulfate, And Camphor, Nimesulide, Civamide Cream 0.075%, Menthol, Drug-Free Gel Containing Ultra-Deformable Phospholipid Vesicles (Tdt 064), 4Jointz Utilizing Acteev Technology, Herbal Therapies, Gel Of Medical Leech (Hirudo Medicinalis) Saliva Extract, And Gel Prepared Using Lake Urmia Mud. One Systematic Review Showed That Topical Diclofenac And Topical Ketoprofen Can Alleviate Pain. However, Another Systematic Review Found That Topical Diclofenac And Ketoprofen Had Limited Efficacy In Knee Oa At 6 To 12Weeks. Many Studies With A Low Level Of Evidence Have Reported Some Pain Mitigation Using The Rest Of Aforementioned Topical Therapies. Conclusions: Although Some Controversy Exists On The Role Of Topical Nsaids, Current Management Guidelines Advise Topical Nsaids As An Option And Even First-Line Therapy For Knee Oa Treatment, Particularly Among Elderly Patients. Topical Nsaids May Be Contemplated As Similar Options To Oral Nsaids And Are Associated With Fewer Gastrointestinal Complications When Compared With Oral Nsaids. Caution Should Be Taken With The Use Of Both Topical And Oral Nsaids, Including Close Adherence To Dosing Regimens And Monitoring, Especially For Patients With Previous Complications Of Nsaids. The Role Of Other Topical Therapies Needs Further Research. 2018, 2018 Informa Uk Limited, Trading As Taylor & Francis Group.

Article	Smith, At	Rendering The Political Aesthetic: Political Legitimacy In Urartian Representations Of The Built Environment	Journal Of Anthropological Archaeology	Anthropological Investigations Of Legitimacy In Ancient Polities Have Generally Appealed To Self-Interested Assessments Of Costs And Benefits To Explain The Commitments Of Subjects To A Political Apparatus. But Ideological Programs Also Strive To Create Affective Ties Between Regimes And Those They Rule By Rendering The Political Aesthetic. From The Mid-Ninth To The Late Seventh Century B.C. The Urartian Empire Controlled The Highlands Of Eastern Anatolia And Southern Transcaucasia From The Headwaters Of The Euphrates To The Lake Urmia Basin, Forwarding Claims To Legitimacy That Redescribed The Political Apparatus. This Study Investigates Urartian Representations Of The Built Environment In Pictorial And Epigraphic Media In Order To Broaden Anthropological Understandings Of Legitimacy, Pluralize Our Understanding Of Ideological Production In Ancient Polities, And Politicize The Relationship Between Artistic Renaissance And State Formation. 2000 Academic Press.
