# Bibliometrix Analaysis for Lake Urmia Peer Reviewed Literature: 1900 to Sept. 2020

The Scopus database was quried for articles with the key words  ( "Lake"  AND  ( "Urmia"  OR  "orumiyeh"  OR  "Orumiyeh" ) ). The quries were done in two batches: from 1) 1900 to August 2019, and 2) August 2019 to September 2020.

The script generates the list of articles used in the literature synthesis and several figures, two of which are used in the synthesis article by Parsinejad et al (2021).
