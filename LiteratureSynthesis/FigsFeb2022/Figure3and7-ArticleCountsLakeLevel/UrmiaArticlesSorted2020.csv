it is easy to evaluate precipitation potential and quality of the system. at the next step, the rate of humidity and also stability of the precipitating system can be analyzed using radar acquired data. whereas extracted date from modis images are expressing the spatial position, therefore in order to study the location of the cloud's seeding, modis images of the selected time intervals along with applying mcm algorithm were used to conclude thick clouds. also, with interpolation of the trmm data, it is possible to deduce maximum precipitation in the form of spatial arena. one of the data categories that is used both for temporal and spatial analysis is radar images which in addition to time, displays the existing humidity range, movement direction, and positions of accumulated precipitation cores. therefore, using this algorithm, it is possible to conclude the most optimized spatial position in order to execute the seeding plan.",NA,"Landsat Satellite;

(especially water and soil) in urmia watershed seems necessary. in macroscopic and coarse scales, sustainable development policy making needs strategic environmental assessment (sea) approach. integrated management plan for watershed of lake urmia is single plan in urmia basin scale. this plan doesn't have necessary strategies for resource management and has a lot of ambiguities and faults. moreover, resource management of this land didn't have requisite strategies. this study will identify causal chains of land degradation with driving force-pressure-state-impact-response (dpsir) model. then, policies are collected in order to protect natural resources, the area, and the profits of local residual and future generations with sea approach. sea studies have just begun in iran, so this study has much educational and investigative value. materials and methods: urmia lake is located at the end of closed endorheic basin of urmia in north west iranian plateau. this basin has nine watersheds. two watersheds are situated on ecological zone. this study is based on description and systematic analysis by using quantitative and qualitative data in sea framework and policy making category. screening and scoping stages are noted to understand state of environment and completion of socio-economic baseline studies. screening stage is noted to initial environmental evaluation by using dpsir model. this model defines the association between environmental processes and environmental impact with human activities. in scoping stage, important scales, variable ecological components, and variable social components have been distinguished. type of these variable components is descriptive indicator. then, preconditions of participation have been mentioned. in this stage, long-term strategic goals (responding to driving forces in basin scale) with vision outlining (1415) and middle-term strategic goals (responding to pressure in watershed scale and responding to state of ecological zone) with vision outlining (1405) has been determined in order to specify sustainable development planning in this land. in evaluation stage, priority of watersheds has been determined for related policies according to variable components. appropriate strategies for decision making and monitoring process have been proposed. finally, optimum mixture of policies has been suggested for sustainable development of this land. discussion and results: the role of human activities in degradation of this land (urmia basin) is indisputable. land degradation driving forces are as follows: 1. the rapid growth of urban population, 2. lack of appropriate planning to meet population needs, 3. major and nonproductive employment in agricultural sector, 4. low literacy and old age in farmers with lands reformation and consequently patches fragmentation and decreasing production efficiency, 5. focus on water supply approach and dam making in water resource management, 6. government incumbency and facilitating in distribution of agricultural inputs, particularly watersector such as hidden subsidies of government for water supply by lack of proper water pricing, 7. lack of participation of agricultural land use integrated management due to participation preconditions in iran (government reliance on oil revenue), thus decision making for using land resource is merely government-owned. the most important pressure of human activity is also as follows: 1. construction of road through the middle of the lake and consequently water flow disorder. 2. irregular dam making and consequently silent rivers. 3. land cover changes and land use conversions. 4. changes in cultivation pattern and consequently consuming more water. 5. serious irrigation deficiency. 6. drilling numerous wells and exploitation of underground water beyond the limit of the water tables. 7. non principal faulty salt exploitation and consequently dust aggravation. conclusion: these pressures lead to dominant positive feedbacks, climatic disturbances and weather quality decadence, quality and quantity of water resource and decreasing and degradation of natural habitats. finally, this land degradation will lead to increase in unemployment, immigration, social insecurity and protestation and diseases. this study by using sea in urmia watershed, has compiled sustainable development policies. the main advantage of this study is incorporation of the results of sea and dpsir. completion of the method used and the result can be a guide for upstream document compilation for sustainable development planning and table 1. middle-term strategies and policies in order to respond to state of lake urmia ecological zone (table presented) programming in this study area. also this is a proper model for compilation of upstream documents of management in other ecosystems and wetland areas. final outcomes of this study are optimum integration of strategies and policies for responding to state, pressures and drivers.",NA,"Dpsir Model;  Lake Urmia;  Policies;  Sea","","Article","","","Scopus",NA

+ so 4 - and cl - /hco 3 - + co 3 - and 18 o and 2 h isotopes as saltwater intrusion indicators. the present study for the first time investigates the hydraulic connection between urmia lake and azarshahr plain aquifer using geochemical ratios and geochemical modeling. materials and methods: urmia lake is a kind of the widest and shallowest lakes in the world and has hyper saline water. a lot of permanent and seasonal river and streams feed the lake. broad and unwanted changes in water and ecology of this lake have been started about 2 decade before and during this time. the water volume of the lake decreased to less than 14 billion m 3 in 2011 from about 32 billion m 3 in 1995. azashahr study area is considered as one of the lake twelve adjacent aquifers that is located between 45,46 to 45, 50 longitudinal and 37,43 to 37,52 latitudinal. its total area is about 457 km 2 that its plain has an area about 124 km 2 . the highest and lowest height in the study area is 3700 m and 1282 m, respectively. its average annual precipitation is about 221.2 mm whereas the average annual evaporation is about 1579 mm. and the most important stream in azarshahr plain is azarshahrchai. it has a southeast-northwest trend and is eliminated to the lake because of wide agricultural usage. on the other hand, the total annual discharge of the aquifer is about 90.64 million m 3 that is one of the groundwater depletion and saltwater intrusion factors in the study area. groundwater salinity is increased in azarshahr plain aquifer because of wide discharge in one side and decrease in urmia lake water level on the other hand. this probably shows that saltwater intrusion to azarshahr plain aquifer is in relation with water level decreases in urmia lake and consequently reveals the hydraulic connection between them. to investigate this connection, groundwater sampling and analysis were conducted and hydraulic connection evaluation was done via three steps as below. graphical methods: three popular piper, stiff and pie chart graphical method was selected and the samples were plotted after the analysis and were compared to urmia lake water samples. star diagram also was plotted for the samples and their map was drawn. on the other hand, pie chart that shows the percentage of water major components was calculated and their distribution in study area was plotted and compared to urmia water component percentage. geochemical ratios: general status of saline water is ci - and na + dominance with 0.86 molar ratio and of course ci - exceed over the alkali metals (na + and k + ). also, mg ++ is more than ca ++ absolutely (i.e. mg ++ /ca ++ =4.5-5). on the other hand, continental fresh water is known with its variable composition and its dominant anions are, hco - 3 , so 4 - and ci - . geochemists try to find also the below geochemical ratios generally for saltwater intrusion resource determination: na + /cl - , ca ++ /mg ++ , ca ++ /hco 3 - + so 4 - and ci - /hco 3 - + co 3 - and also some isotopes such as boron, oxygen and hydrogen. in the present study, geochemical ratios were calculated and plotted in study area for saltwater intrusion resource finding and also evaluation of hydraulic connection between urmia lake and azarshahr plain aquifer. geochemical inverse modeling: hydro-geochemical modeling is an important tool for recognition of geochemical reactions in groundwater. in the modeling process, geochemical reactions during the flow path such as solution, precipitation, mixing and cation exchange are simulated and compared with final water composition. solute aggregation in groundwater can be supposed as a reaction of water with surrounding minerals in porous media. hydro-geologists utilize the water chemical data for classification of various mineral balance situations. in this study, ion activity product (iap) and balance constant (k) and also saturation index (si) were used for probable minerals, composition creation and comparison with probable phases in urmia lake water sample. therefore, because of enormous volume of calculations in balance reactions and also finding the balance constant for reactions, phreeqc computer code has been used and probable phases in groundwater mixed samples and urmia lake water sample were created and compared to each other. these were carried out to find if there is any chemical connection between lake and azarshahr aquifer. the mixed samples were created in three paths near the lake. mixing reaction was done between samples number 18 and 19, 20 and 23 and also between 25 and 22 in porous media presentation. results and discussion: geochemical analysis results of groundwater samples and urmia lake indicated that dominant cation in azarshar aquifer and urmia lake are ca ++ and na + , respectively. also groundwater dominant anions are hco 3 - , so 4 - and ci - during the flow direction, whereas dominant anion in lake water is ci"" that is distinct characteristic of marine composition. piper diagram revealed that groundwater type in study area are ca ++ - na + - hco 3 - and ca ++ -na + -cl - whereas urmia lake water is in na + -cl - type. the nearest sample to urmia lake water composition is sample number 7 that is located out of aquifer domain and is affected by anthropogenic activities probably. also stiff diagram of groundwater samples and urmia lake aren't similar to each other and show the different sources. na + /cl - ratio in saltwater intrusion is lower than marine values (i.e. molar ratio&lt;0.86). on the other hand, ratio more than 1 is the indicator of anthropogenic activities such as residential area wastewater. na + /cl - ratio distribution in the aquifer domain shows that in the northwest and west of aquifer, there is na + /cl - ratio less than marine ratio. therefore, there is saltwater intrusion from northwest of the study area. also evaluation of ca ++ /(hco 3 - + so 4 - ) and ca ++ /mg ++ ratios revealed that, these ratios in aquifer domain are more than those in urmia lake water spectacularly. as it can be clearly seen, minimum value for ca ++ /mg ++ ratio in aquifer domain starts from about 29 and for ca ++ /(hco 3 - + so 4 - ) ratio starts from about 0.2, whereas these ratios are 0.01 and 0.03 for urmia lake, respectively. this shows no relation between aquifer groundwater and urmia lake. other popular geochemical ratio for saltwater intrusion is reveile ratio explained as [cl - /(hco 3 - + co 3 - )]. ratio more than 1.5 depicts the saltwater intrusion. reveile distribution plot represented that there is saltwater intrusion from domain northwest direction but it is not from the lake because of its direction and also south-north trend. hydro-geochemical modeling of different groundwater sample mixing in flow direction and the nearest distance to the lake has been indicated as a comparsion between probable phases saturation index. the results show that mixing of samples had been done but probable phases did not, same as the probable phases in urmia lake water. conclusion: saltwater intrusion from urmia lake to adjacent aquifers because of their heavy pumping rate is one of probable factors in water level depletion of urmia lake. on the other hand, finding the relationship between different types of water resources to each other by geochemistry is a popular way that have not been done so far in urmia lake. therefore, use of geochemistry studies and its different branches were the base of this study. at last, after the use of geochemical ratios and geochemistry modeling, their results indicated that there is saltwater intrusion in azarshahr plain aquifer, but it is not from urmia lake water. probably it comes from adjacent salty pans to the aquifer.",NA,"Azarshahr;  Geochemical Inverse Modelling;  Hydraulic Connection;  Saltwater Intrusion;  Urmia Lake","","Article","","","Scopus",NA

Studies","http://doi.org/NA","introduction: common pool water resources (cpwrs) face overuse and congestion due to increased competition for the non-excludability and subtractability nature of their use. in the cpwrs conflicts, beneficiaries base their actions on individual rationality which negatively affect all users eventually due to the lack of trust between them, their self-optimizing tendencies, and inadequate information about the consequences of their actions. game theory provides a formal mathematical framework to strategic analysis of such conflict and to able presenting some institutions to prevent tragedy of commons. lake urmia is the most valuable ecosystem located in the same name basin in iran in the recent years, the basin's upstream water resources faced to overuse due to an increase in the attitudes of parties to gain more economic benefits from agriculture activities which led to conflicts as well as threats to lake urmia's life. the literatures which studied this environmental crisis are limited with respect to understanding strategic interactions between the actors and how such interactions may affect the results of the lake urmia water conflict. materials and methods: in order to study the lake urmia water conflict, basic information were prepared through a review of the relative literatures, the technical documents, and the news reports. these collected data were completed by referring to experts opinions and finally the conflict was modeled and analyzed based on the gmcr process of resolving conflicts. as a non-cooperative game theoretical model, the graph model for conflict resolution (gmcr) was developed through a combination of extensive form of conflict analysis and graph theory. figure 1 outlines the gmcr process of resolving conflicts which involves two main stages including modeling and analyzing. the modeling stage includes defining decision makers and their options, removing infeasible states of the conflict, specifying allowable transitions from each state for each player, and finally defining the relative preferences of each player over each state. in the analyzing stage, stability of the feasible states for each player is first analyzed using the formal mathematical definitions named non-cooperative solution concepts. the second stage is followed by finding the equilibria or likely outcomes of the conflict (states which are stable for all stakeholders under a given solution concept). if a given state is known as equilibrium under a range of solution concepts, then it is a strong equilibrium with a higher likelihood of being the final outcome of the game. after that, some alternative scenarios are defined in order to examine the sensitivity of the results to changing input information. finally, strategic insights from decision makers' interactions are presented to help them for better decision making. discussion: of results and conclusions: as can be seen in table 1, there were five decision makers with seven options in the lake urmia water conflict. the number of total states of the conflict was 128 which reduced to 72 after infeasible states were removed. then, allowable moves from a given state to each other and the player's preferences were defined respectively. based on the dm's preferences, the ministry of agri-jihad (maj) has preferred to continue its new agriculture development projects while it has tended to protect the basin's farmers to improve their cultivation and irrigation styles. although the ministry of energy (moe) has interested to implement interbasin water transformation projects but it has not liked to stop its new water resources development plans. the basin's provinces (bp) have disagreed to stop their new local water and agricultural development plans. farmers of the basin (f) have liked to continue their illegal overuse from upstream water resources of the basin and the central government (cg) has preferred to take no action to force maj, moe, and bp to stop their new development plans. after the conflict was modeled, the stability analysis was applied through non-cooperative solution concepts followed by an alternative preference scenario developed in order to find how changes in decision makers' preferences affect the initial results. according to table 2, eight outcomes became known as the game equilibria. the
